         * Lesser Essences will be more abundant throughout the campaign, giving you an easier time upgrading your items.  
         * Perfect Essences are also a new tier, providing powerful bonuses, not just a higher magnitude of the lower tier Essences.

### Exceptional Items  
* New Exceptional Bases will drop, having higher quality or extra sockets.  
    *    Exceptional Unique items also exist!

* This will randomize the value of modifiers anywhere rom 80% to 120%  
    *    Meaning you can reach values higher than possible before.  
* Sanctified Items can no longer be crafted upon, so this will often be the  final step of crafting a mirror-tier item.
