# [Notes on the update / changes](https://mobalytics.gg/poe-2/guides/0-3-the-third-edict-reveal-summary#rise-of-the-abyssal-league-mechanic-6)

### Act 4 and 3 interlude acts  
* No more cruel  

### Support Gem Cap removal  
* This means you can use the same Support Gem on multiple Active Skills  

### Tired Support Gems
* Some may have unique effects

### Lineage Support Gems  
* Support Gems that are almost like Unique items.  
* They grant unique effects to your skills.  
* "Endgame" gated, could be very very hard to get.  

### Deflection  
* Deflection is a new mechanic tied to Evasion/Dexterity  
* Deflection will be gained through Armour modifiers & Passive Tree.  
* Deflection Rating provides a chance to Deflect damage from Hits.  
* Prevents 40% of the damage from those Hits and Ailments they inflict.  
* The exact chance to Deflect also depends on the attacker's Accuracy.  
* Acts as evasion for flat dmg reduction builds effectively.  

### Rise of the Abyssal - League Mechanic  
* Rise of the Abyssal will be the new League mechanic for 0.3.  
* Maps will have more monsters from the Abyss to fight; 
    * Defeating Abyss Monsters will lead to a new currency type, "Bones."  
    * These Bones can be applied to specific items, granting them an extra modifier that you can choose from a pool of 3.  

### New Modifier "% Armour Applies to Ele Damage"
* Like Deflection, this modifier can be rolled on Equipment and specced through the Passive Tree.  

### New Currency Tiers  
* Currency Orbs will now have tiers that affect the tier of modifier you  roll.  
* For example, a Perfect Transmute will grant the best tier modifier.  
* Currency will now have regular, Greater, and Perfect Tiers.  
* This also  applies for Augments, Regals, Exalts, and Chaos Orbs.  

### Essences  
* Essences will now have 4 tiers:  
    *    Lesser  
    *   Regular  
    *    Greater  
    *    Perfect  
* Lesser Essences will be more abundant throughout the campaign, giving you an easier time upgrading your items.  
* Perfect Essences are also a new tier, providing powerful bonuses, not just a higher magnitude of the lower tier Essences.  

# Exceptional Items  
* New Exceptional Bases will drop, having higher quality or extra sockets.  
    *    Exceptional Unique items also exist!  

### Sanctified Items (new version to corrupting an item?)  
* Sanctified Items are a new way to try and create the best items.  
* This will randomize the value of modifiers anywhere rom 80% to 120%  
    *    Meaning you can reach values higher than possible before.  
* Sanctified Items can no longer be crafted upon, so this will often be the  final step of crafting a mirror-tier item.  
* We saw a Omen being applied to a Divine Orb to sanctify and item upon use.  
    * New Omens
    * Hinekora's Lock added (idk what that is)

### Major Trade Update  
* Npc broker for item sales.  
    * Upon interaction get teleported to player's (seller's) hideout.  
    * Buy through the broker there  
    * See seller's other items for sale there too  

### Atlas Tree Changes  
* Tree sections for Breach, Delirium, Expedition, and Ritual;  
  * Initial 2 passive points much sooner in the endgame.  
  * No need to challenge the Pinnacle Boss for your first two points  
  * Need to complete a much simpler quest instead.  
    * Such as defeating a Unique Monster during a Delirium Encounter  

### Pinnacle Boss Splinters  
* Pinnacle Bosses will now be accessed with Splinters.  
    *    Challenge different level difficulties with a different amounts.  
* Pinnacle Bosses much  sooner in your endgame journey  
* Pinnacle Boss difficulty is no longer tied to the Atlas Tree, 
    * Those old points now grant more Splinters instead.  
* Note: Uber Arbiter of Ash now requires special Fragments; 
  * Which are  obtained through Citadel bosses with your Boss Atlas Tree maxed out.  

### Additional Notes

* 150+ New Notables have been added to the Passive Tree  
* 35 New Areas
