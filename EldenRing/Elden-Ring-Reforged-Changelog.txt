Reverted the behavior of the Sign of the All-Knowing item to use a projectile again for now, due to the custom behavior not working with the new Elden Ring update.

Rescinded support for the "UnlockTheFps" DLL mod as raising your FPS above 60 has been repeatedly noted to cause issues with game behaviors, including Reforged systems like deflects (for instance, causing Waterfowl Dance to no longer be deflectable). Please avoid using FPS-unlocking mods and addons, as ELDEN RING is simply not built to support it.

Fixed a critical issue in the bundled "Scripts-Data-Exposer-FS" DLL mod where various game parameter values were incorrectly missing or not read in various situations. This affected the scaling of status buildup from Arcane and other effects, the scaling of FP regen from Intelligence and other effects, and the functioning of the Spiritcaller Fortune.

Fixed an issue that occurred when repeating the same casting combo animation between two different spells, or repeatedly using Decree of Haima without moving, that would cause your legs to lock in place.

Version 1.4.9A

Changed how right and left light attacks chain into one another. They will generally attempt to maintain their "progress" through the respective combo when making the switch, unless the weapons have separate amounts of light attacks in their movesets.

The Twinblade Talisman will now apply to the special paired off-hand attack of Rellana's Twin Blades.

Applied the custom ERR transitions for certain right-handed attacks of certain movesets to their left-handed equivalents for a smoother combat flow.

The Whirling Blades Charm will now work on other light attack types.

Fixed an issue where weapon catalysts held along with a regular catalyst could not perform charged or channeled spells correctly.

Fixed a long-standing vanilla issue where casting a right hand "quick spell" such as Swift Glintstone Shard or Catch Flame after left hand attack would use the left hand weapon's spell scaling.

Added some further experimental attempts to resolve the reverse roll issue.

Version 1.4.8H

Torrent will now respect the "Toggle dash input" controls setting and dash with the Stealth input, and dismount with the Stealth + Interact input, when it is enabled.

Version 1.4.8G

Added a special exception rule to regular catalysts and Weapon Catalysts being wielded together. Using the regular catalyst's input will now determine whether the weapon catalyst should be used instead, based on the type of the spell being cast. This allows using both types of spells while being able to attack with the weapon, without employing a dual catalyst.
  - Example: When left-handing a seal and right-handing a sorcery weapon catalyst, pressing L1 will cast an incantation with the seal, and a sorcery with the weapon catalyst.

Added a control option to disable weapon catalyst casting, allowing off-hand attacks while using weapons designated as weapon catalysts. Rellana's Twin Blades will use their unique left-handed paired attack with this option toggled.

Patches will now sell the Leather armor set at the end of his quest.

Updated some values in the Fortune of the Brave, improving the negation at higher stages of Northern Temper and improving the damage dealt by the boosted heavy charged attack.

Clarified some wording in the Fortune of the Brave description when describing the fact that you pay the Northern Temper price for a boosted heavy attack either when you get hit during it, or when you fully charge it, meaning the payment can be avoided by releasing the button to do an uncharged heavy attack. It does not mean that you will incur Temper penalties for receiving hits during the Endure effect.

Fixed an issue where you could not perform off-hand critical hits while wielding a main-hand weapon incapable of critical hits, such as a catalyst.

Fixed various issues surrounding the fire damage from Rellana's Twin Blades, such as nullifying the fire damage of the Moon-and-Fire Stance skill, and dealing magic damage on the off-hand critical hits.

Fixed an issue where the Dragonscale Curio would not function properly with the Fortune of the Brave.

It is now possible to perform a critical attack with a left hand weapon by pressing the "left hand attack" input (Guard + Light Attack).

Added critical hits to Bows and Shields. Adjusted Whip critical hits to use Nightreign animations. Default weapon class critical modifiers are:

Greatbows: 90
Small Shields: 110
Medium Shields: 100
Greatshields: 90

Adjusted shield scaling values to be consistent and have updated scaling every other weapon class already had in ERR. Shields now have the following updated values by default:
Small Shields: 144/0 Str/Dex -> 125/175 Str/Dex
Medium Shields: 240/0 Str/Dex -> 175/125 Str/Dex
Great Shields: 300/0 Str/Dex -> 225/75 Str/Dex

Updated the Body Hues and Armor Dye system to allow wearing Body Hues and Armor Dyes at the same time. This opens up many new possible color customization options.

Fixed an issue where matching skills did not contribute to Northern Temper on the Fortune of the Brave.

Fixed an issue where Lord's Stomp did not work on Curved Swords.

Fixed more NPCs that could accidentally obtain random Crystal Tear effects.

Fixed an issue where Azash, Pride of the Redmanes was lacking cloth physics (this time for reals).

Updated the Reforged Launcher to reject outdated regulation.bin files from addons, to avoid players from missing out on mod changes due to keeping old addons around, such as outdated versions of Map for Goblins Reforged which they should be manually updating every time.

Reverted the dash delay from 0.25s to 0.4s in an attempt to resolve reverse roll issues.

Reverted to a prior build of the Transmogrify DLL to resolve an issue where you appear fully clothed in the character creator no matter what.

Made adjustments to the Fortune of the Brave:
Fixed an issue where Stomp skills were not properly registered.

Northern Temper buildup will now slightly ramp up at higher levels of the effect, including both gains and losses.

Further clarified the Northern Temper status icon.

- A visual effect will now play when reaching a full stage of Corrupting Zeal.
- An additional visual effect will now be present when close to, and in, Stage 3 of Corrupting Zeal.

Version 1.4.7

Added the Fortune of the Brave. This rare fortune is focused on building up your temper by attacking and avoiding damage, then trading into the enemy's assault with a powerful, unstaggerable charged strike. It may be obtained along the northeastern cliffs of the Capital Outskirts in the Altus Plateau.

Added Frenzyflame Grease, which may be crafted to inflict madness with your armaments. It is learned from the new Mad Craftsman's Cookbook [4], which may be obtained in the vicinity of the Darklight Catacombs in the Land of Shadow.

Decreased the maximum poise damage bonus gained through strength from 30% to 25%.

Adjusted stamina regen speed values from the current equip load ratio to cap out at differences of +/- 50 instead of +/- 60. This means that 0% equip load, you will now gain 50 bonus stamina regen instead of 60, and at 100% equip load you will now lose 50 stamina regen instead of 60.

Fixed an issue where the flavor lore blurb for the Fortune of the Adherent was missing.

Fixed an issue with the self-damage of melee range 3 slot incantations being able to hit enemies when using the Fortune of the Adherent.

Fixed a vanilla issue where the hits with the Fire Sword of the "two handed" Rellana's Twin Blades would not be affected by weapon buffs.

Fixed a vanilla issue where the Frozen Needle and Ruins Greatsword R2 projectiles were not tagged as heavy attacks for damage boosting effects, and the Blacksteel Greathammer guard counter holy burst was not tagged as a guard counter for damage boosting effects.

Fixed a vanilla issue where the Roaring Bash skill was not tagged as a roar attack for damage boosting effects.

Version 1.4.6C

Fixed the Adherent fortune not buffing Hornsent incantations properly.

The Spiraltree Seal and Barbed Staff-spear will now buff all Hornsent incantations instead of just Spiral incantations.

Version 1.4.6B

Fixed Thopp's Barrier and Rejection having the wrong spell classification.

Fixed Adherent issues.

Created a patch file for this version.

Version 1.4.6

Added the Fortune of the Adherent. This common Fortune is aimed at offensive incantation casters. By repeatedly casting incantations of the same spell school, you boost your incantation attack power for that school, but when you reach the final stage, every cast damages your health. You may reduce this effect, and thus preserve your health, by casting incantations of different schools. Only one school may be boosted at a time.

The minor Fortune of the Adherent increases your casting speed for some time after you cast a support incantation.

Decreased weapon AR by around 3%, but increased weapon skill damage by around 6%. This is a small change that will slightly nudge weapons towards using skills for damage as damaging skills could previously feel a bit redundant compared to just pressing regular weapon attacks.

Fixed Spirit Ashes in the previous version having wrong stats when dueled in the Proving Grounds due to the dueling system not being updated for behind the scenes Spirit Ash changes that came with the Spiritcaller Fortune.

Backported a vanilla change where the Ornamental Straight Sword R2 under Golden Tempering can be cancelled into the final stab early by releasing the R2 input.

The Minor Fortune of the Bulwark now "increases non-deflect guarding effectiveness" instead of its previous effect.

Spiritcaller adjustments:
Attack and HP/Stamina penalties will now only apply while a Spirit Ash is summoned.
Healing received by the Spirit Ash is now reduced equal to the damage negation that Spirit Ash gets from the Spirit Ring, due to how healing and damage negation stack.
Spirit Ashes now receive an additional heal automatically when ending Spirit Fury and the Spirit Ring is reset.

Increased the base healing received by Spirit Ashes, but applied a scaling heal penalty to multi-entity Spirit Ashes. This change makes the healing received between single and multi-entity Spirit Ashes more balanced.

Fixed an issue with the Witch's Glintstone Crown (Broken) where it would not function correctly and be unavailable for transmogrification.

Fixed the Spiritcaller Fortune not showing its status icon.

Version 1.4.5

Added a new fortune, the Fortune of the Spiritcaller. The Spiritcaller fortune focuses on fighting closely alongside your Spirit Ash using a new Spirit Ring mechanic. It can be found from the boss of the Road's End Catacombs, and will automatically be inserted into your inventory if the boss has been defeated before updating.

The Glintstone Sorcerer Ashes the boss previously dropped have been moved to the Raya Lucaria graveyard.

Updated status icons with multiple new status icons. New status icons can be found for the Challenge modifiers of Enemy Crystal Tears, Turbo Mode, Forced Combat, and Additional Enemies. New icons also exist for increasing all 8 attributes, increasing HP and FP restoration, using the Oath of Vengeance skill, and using the Dragon Communion Flesh and Fingerprint Nostrum.

Fixed Rejection and Thopp's Barrier not showing icons for their cast speed increase.

Added new weapon passive effects:
- Inquisitor's Girandole: Weapon deals enhanced fire burn to bleeding enemies
- Executioner's Greataxe: Critical attacks slightly restore FP
- Raptor Talons: Slightly strengthens jump attacks

The Rotten Crystal Staff will now change the visuals of Crystalian sorceries to those used by the Putrid Crystalians and apply more rot buildup.

Increased the animation speed and tracking of the Bayle's Flame Lightning spell.

Increased the tracking on the projectiles of the Collapsing Stars spell.

Dragon Communion Flesh and Fingerprint Nostrum HP loss will no longer stack when these items are used together.

Separated the Godfrey, Gurranq, and Promised Consort boss fight phases into two separate healthbars. Having the total health of these bosses split between two bars instead of having it all in one bar makes it easier to see differences in damage when playing with high HP multipliers, like higher difficulties or co-op. 

Fixed Boss Rush not notifying the player that runes will be lost on starting it.

Potentially fixed Spirit Ashes not being enrageable in co-op.

Version 1.4.4A

Fixed the Deflect Tutorial enemy not applying blockstun, making it impossible Guard Counter and therefore impossible to complete the tutorial in version 1.4.4.

Fixed Smithing Master Hewg accidentally requiring you have the Whetstone Knife to Enkindle Ashes of War.

Made the wind-up to the Flying Dragon enemies "fly-by fire attack" more obvious by having the fire appear on its mouth earlier in the animation.

- Alabaster Lord's Sword: Skill hits empower next heavy attacks with lightning.
- Onyx Lord's Sword: Skill hits empower next dash attacks with lightning.
- Bloodhound's Fang: Slightly strengthens jumping attacks.
- Rallying Standard: Empowering allies increases endurance. This effect grants +2 endurance when empowering an ally, and +1 endurance for each additional ally. Stacks up to +8 endurance.

Updated talisman effects:
- Taker's Cameo: Slightly increases overall HP regen as well as its original effect.
- Ancestral Spirit Horn: Slightly increases overall FP regen as well as its original effect.

Improved Fated Fire Knight weapon scaling curves.

Reduced the AR of the Great Weapon classes (Greatsword, Greataxe, Greathammer) by 2%.

Added a Stake of Marika to the Sellia Crystal Tunnel.

Added different types of postures to multiple different NPCs.

Fixed Samurai's stat changes not being reflected on the character select screen.

Fixed typos.

Version 1.4.3

Added the "Toggle dash input" option to Reforged options at sites of grace. Enabling this option will allow you to dash by using the Crouch input (L3). To crouch, you can hold the Interact input while pressing Crouch.

Re-added the "Instant dodge input" option to Reforged options at sites of grace. Enabling this option will allow you to dodge instantly upon button press, but the dodge will occur before you start to dash by holding the button. The "Toggle dash input" option is recommended when using this.

Changed the dash mechanic to use custom-coded behavior. As part of this, reduced the built-in delay for dashing to begin from 0.4 seconds to 0.3 seconds. Please report any issues spotted with the new dashing behavior; ideally, it should cause no problems and be almost unnoticeable.

Changed the dash state (for effects such as the Thunderous Beast Charm) to persist during the "dash 180" pivot animation.

Added a new Dragon Communion generator Incantation, Dragonrend. This incantation can be found at the Church of Dragon Communion in Limgrave.

Slightly adjusted some starting class stats based on feedback:
- Hero: Arcane 11 -> 10, Faith 8 -> 9
- Bandit: Strength 10 -> 9, Endurance 12 -> 13
- Samurai: Arcane 9 -> 8, Endurance 13 -> 14
- Confessor: Intelligence 9 -> 8, Arcane 9 -> 8, Vigor 10 -> 12

- Guide: Vigor 14 -> 13, Faith 15 -> 14, Dexterity 10 -> 11, Intelligence 9 -> 10

Improved the balance of "Rally" HP restoration (Malenia's Great Rune) based on weapon classes. This is a buff to this mechanic mostly on slower weapons, as the HP restored will now gradually increase with slower and slower weapon classes.

Added a Stake of Marika to the Knights of the Greatjar fight location.

Increased Starscourge Radahn's base HP by 8%, but also doubled his critical damage taken and increased the amount of time the player has to run to his head to land the critical.

Fixed issues with chain-casting into the Magic Glintblade spell.

Fixed an issue where Mystic Ashes could be performed on Torrent unlike other Ashes of War.

Fixed a multitude of visual and not-so-visual issues with the Disciplined stance.

Fixed a plethora of blending issues with all new postures, either by adding blending to animations that didn't have any, improving the blending system, or fixing bugs. This remains a work in progress, so report unsightly animation transitions in the bug report forum.

Increased the threshold for the attempted backjump animation fix.

Fixed the LOD terrain texture in Limgrave mismatching the color of the actual terrain. It will now correctly appear green instead of yellowish, masking pop-in. Credits to rossano96 on Nexus for the fix.

Various asset placement fixes in Chapel of Anticipation, Caelid, Limgrave and Mountaintops of the Giants.

Version 1.4.2B

Fixed an issue with some slender postures' legs becoming all twisted in certain situations, such as while casting or drinking a Flask of Tears.

Re-upload to fix an issue with Gideon in the previous version.

Version 1.4.0E

Casting speed will now also affect how quickly magic spells may transition into weapon skills and attacks. While improving the value of the statistic for hybrid builds, it also resolves the issue of Mystic Ashes and weapon catalysts being unable to benefit from cast speed.

Added the Rock Pot, the Hefty Rock Pot's diminutive cousin. Its recipe was added to the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook [5], sold by the Nomadic Merchant in the eastern Mistwood in Limgrave.

Ash of War: No Skill may now uniquely be applied to unique armaments, regardless of rarity.

Overhauled the minor Kaiden encampment containing the Lord's Stomp skill, and performed various minor asset cleanup around Fingerstone Hill.

Adjusted Ash of War: Lord's Stomp to be more reliable in sloped terrain.

Fixed an issue where using Mystic Ashes while having no spells equipped in your spell slots would crash to desktop.

Fixed an issue where using a Mystic Ash while having selected a spell slot which is ahead of a spell slot containing the spell matching the Mystic Ash would cause the active spell slot to change.

Fixed some text issues with Mystic Ashes.

Version 1.4.0D

Fixed Iji unintentionally having a menu for creating Mystic Ashes. This menu also didn't even work.

Version 1.4.0B

Fixed Iji unintentionally having a menu for creating Mystic Ashes. This menu also didn't even work.

Fixed some enemy modifiers having too much guard pierce on their damage.

Fixed some issues with Lord's Stomp and increased its hitbox size.

Fixed the Lucent Baldachin's Reliquary item not working.

Updated mod translations to the latest version.

Version 1.4.0

Introduced Mystic Ashes, a type of Ash of War corresponding to a spell costing 1 spell slot or less. Mystic Ashes may be applied to catalysts to gain access to a spell via the Skill input. This way, you may assign an easily accessible spell to a catalyst, and cast it without cycling through the spell list.

Mystic Ashes become available for purchase for 3 Lost Ashes each at Smithing Master Hewg upon purchasing the Spellsmith's Etching Tool at Smithing Master Iji in Liurnia of the Lakes. You must own the corresponding spell to be able to purchase its Mystic Ash.

All the usual requirements and limitations apply to the spell. Due to a technical limitation, these casts will not currently benefit from cast speed increases for chaining spells.

Added default spell-casting skills to most catalysts. Some catalysts received spells unavailable as Mystic Ashes:
- Crystal Staff: Crystal Release
- Rotten Crystal Staff: Crystal Torrent
- Azur's Glintstone Staff: Comet
- Lusat's Glintstone Staff: Star Shower
- Prince of Death's Staff: Creeping Rancor
- Staff of the Great Beyond: Guiding Microcosm
- Golden Order Seal: Law of Regression
- Erdtree Seal: Great Heal
- Dragon Communion Seal: Dragonmaw
- Frenzied Flame Seal: Howl of Shabriri

Added a new legendary incantation: Binding Stake. This iconic attack of Radagon of the Golden Order may be obtained from his remembrance. The spell icon and basic effects were provided by long-time contributor Tigertom.

Added a new Ash of War: Lord's Stomp, a physical ground splitting attack taught to the Crucible Knights by their lord. It may be found in a new Kaiden encampment in the Mountaintops of the Giants, and it comes with associated Enkindled Ashes of War.

Added the Lucent Baldachin's Reliquary, a reusable tool which allows the user to create a Baldachin's Blessing at will. It may be found in the Roundtable Hold after Fia's demise at the hands of D. This item uses the visuals and effects for a cut "Lucent Baldachin's Blessing" item which would have had a similar effect.

Clarified the hidden effect of the Baldachin's Blessing in its description.

The Warrior Jar Shard talisman will now chip off of a wounded Warrior Jar Alexander in the desert after successfully defeating Starscourge Radahn, and be available for pickup without slaying the warrior jar. Alexander must not be upset with you at the time Radahn is defeated for this to occur.

Random balance adjustments:
- Decreased the damage or status buildup of pot items by around 8%.
- Decreased the attack power of weapon catalysts to account for the fact that they receieved unintentional attack power scaling increases in the previous update.
- Adjusted the power of multiple catalyst R2 attacks in slight ways.
- Increased the enraged attack power of the Jolan and Anna Spirit Ashes.

Catalyst cast speed boosts will now no longer stack for the most part, as 50 cast speed has been added to the players base stats and removed from catalyst effects.

Changed vanilla "rolling arts" behavior (such as Quickstep) so that holding the Dash input will unlock the movement from any locked-on target. This should prevent the player from stopping dead in their tracks and facing their target when trying to Quickstep away while dashing. It may also improve the reliability of Quicksteps up close in the target's face.

Increased the speed of the pivot animation, and the pivot animation will now transition into dashing attacks instead of stationary light/heavy attacks.

Applied some fixes to attempt to resolve various vanilla issues involving locking onto a target and performing an evasive action, such as a jump, dodge roll or step skill, while unlocking from the target, colloquially known as "backjump", "reverse roll" etc.

Attempted a fix for the Fortune of the Reeds being frequently "dead angled" by flanking enemies. This may or may not have any effect.

Added a hint message at the Great Astrolabe in the Carian Moongazing Grounds.

Fixed the Codex displaying Adept mode enemy poise values instead of Reforged mode.

Fixed some instances where the Curseblade Labirith boss wouldn't lose its invisibility.

Reduced the impact damage of status afflicting arrows and bolts so that they aren't purely better than non-status projectiles.

Poison and Rot will now display a particle effect on application to make it easier to tell how many times it has been applied to a target. This also makes it more satisfying to apply these status effects.

Fixed the Stake of Marika in the Lakeside Crystal Cave spawning the player too close to some Crystal Snails.

Version 1.3.2F

Added significantly more i-frames to Raptor of the Mists followup animation. These i-frames are applied to the animation itself and so will be cancelled if or when the animation is cancelled into a jump attack.

Some enemies that used to have zero hitstop were given this half hitstop, and some enemies with full hitstop had their hitstop time reduced to half hitstop.

Added thrusting R1 light attacks to the Parrying Dagger, Main-gauche, and Night's Edge daggers, using a mix of Dagger and Thrusting Sword animations.

Added the "Holy Moonlight Sword" Greatsword 2H R1s to the Bastard Sword.

Added the sweeping 1H R2 Greatsword heavy attacks from the Bastard Sword to the Iron Greatsword.

Fixed enemies with Base HP values in the range of 2200 to 2500 having broken HP values in version 1.3.1.

Version 1.3.1

Added new auxiliary effects to the 5 damage stats of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Faith, and Arcane.
- Strength: Increases poise damage dealt, up to a maximum increase of about 20%. Still also increases physical defense.
- Dexterity: Increases critical damage dealt, up to a maximum increase of about 40%. Also reduces the stamina consumption of attacks and spells by up to 10%.
- Intelligence: Increases the FP regeneration from attacks and spells, up to a maximum increase of about 30%. Also increases elemental defense.
- Faith: Increases the duration of common buffs, up to a maximum increase of about 60%. Also increases poise by up to 10%.
- Arcane: Increases the amount of buildup enemies take from all status effects, up to a maximum increase of about 30%. Still also increases discovery.

Balance notes:
- The poise damage of multiple lower cost spells has been bumped up slightly by 10 or 20 to make them just a tiny bit stronger. The amount of spells adjusted is too large to list.
- All weapons with status buildup have adjusted values, and the buildup scaling from Arcane is not reflected on the weapons stat page, so it may appear higher or lower than before. The buildup of other items like spells and consumables has never appeared on stat screens, so those won't be noticeably different.
- Similarly, the status resistance of multiple weaker enemies has been adjusted so that status procs against them are more common, especially slower statuses like poison, but the changes are too large to list individually.

Players in Massive Frame will now break objects while dashing, but now will have slightly more stamina reduction when dashing at higher equip load frames, about 10% more stamina cost per frame above Nimble.

Increased how fast the Thunderous Beast Charm builds charge when sprinting, but added damage falloff to the explosion effect. This increases its effectiveness versus singular targets like bosses, but not groups of enemies.

Decreased the effectiveness of instant Heal spells by around 10%.

Added a Stake of Marika to the Commander Niall fight in Castle Sol.

Decreased the effectiveness of some Binding Runes:

The Dread Talisman has been reworked with a new effect to help with the casting of the slow Dragon Communion spells. This talisman now provides full immunity to stagger when casting Dragon Communion spells, but it only provides this resistance for a single hit. It also slightly raises the potency of Dragon Communion incantations.

Igon's Drake Hunt will now fire a vertical spread of seven arrows instead of just a single arrow, considerably enhancing its power against multiple enemies.

Updated the Auxiliary category of the Warmaster fortune to include Torches.

Added an additional damage negation boost to the Barbarian fortune when the enhanced HP restoration effect is active. This damage negation boost also scales higher with lower equip load ratios, from 2% to 22%.

Buffed the effect applied by the Spotted Whip's Painful Strike skill to decrease the action speed of enemy attack recovery animations, in addition to its original stamina regeneration debuff.

Equip load frames now affect the power of the Ground Slam type skills:

Added a visual effect when triggering Barbarian's enhanced healing on hit.

When possible, the Boss Rush will now automatically restock all consumables used during a run. This will always restock consumables on a successful run, but will only restock consumables that aren't auto-refilled on death on a failed run. This is because the auto-refill mechanic that can be toggled in the sorting chest will override the new restock mechanic when loading from a death.

This is based on @tom's new Material Param Exposer DLL, which allows using FromSoftware's material tinting methods employed with enemies such as the Glintstone Sorcerers. These types of dyes work differently from the original system, and will look better with certain combinations, but look worse with others. Also improved the scripts that apply Body Hues to be less resource intensive.

Upgraded the Dancer's Castanets to be an equippable talisman, which raises the potency of dancing attacks and additionally synergizes with Perfect Actions. It can be equipped after attempting to give it to Tanith. If the Dancer's Castanets were already given to Tanith before the update the talisman will be inserted into your inventory.

Improved the accuracy of the Rancor Shot skill's arrows.

Version 1.2.2

Added hard mode effects to multiple enemies that will allow them to act more quickly out of certain animations. This is focused on regular enemies which are a bit too basic to get complex AI changes, and is done by giving them faster cancel windows on specific animations. This mostly affects basic enemies like Giant Crabs, Scaly Misbegotten, Trolls, and other slow or simple enemies. This does not affect how enemy team attack works.

Updated the Flying Dragon Greyll boss into a Death Dragon, using unused visual effects for a cut type of Dragon that would have been found in Farum Azula. It uses new versions of the special attacks from all the other kinds of Dragon bosses with a Destined Death theme.

Added the Crucible Knot Talisman effect to Crucible Knights and fixed their hidden Crucible Scale talisman effect to apply to criticals done from behind as well as from the front.

Slightly decreased the tracking and grab hitbox of the Golden Hippo's charge, but added a body hitbox to it behind the grab hitbox.

Decreased the initial hitbox size of the spreading lasers in the Phase 2 of the Promised Consort on the attack where he pulls up rocks from the ground with his swords.

Version 1.0.0

This major update introduces support for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, as well as various new additions.

## Systems
- Introduced Ember Pieces. This is a new type of collectible restricted to Shadow of the Erdtree. Ember Pieces can be earned by exploring, but also by doing various activities in the Realm of Shadow. Ember Pieces are spent to unseal and strengthen Shadowed Curios.

- Introduced Shadowed Curios. Sealed curios may be found in certain locations of the Realm of Shadow. Unsealing them with Ember Pieces at a site of grace grants you a permanent new perk which is triggered on a condition based on the respective curio. Each curio lets you choose and strengthen one of 3 unique effects that occur upon the trigger condition, to further customize your character build. Curios offer a more active build component in comparison to the passive bonuses of Runeforging. Curio icons are painted by poeconcept and atomicjest.

- Consolidated the Level up, Runeforging, Shadow Realm blessing and Shadowed curios menus at sites of grace in a new "Strengthen character" submenu.

- Added a new rare fortune, the Fortune of the Bulwark. It is a fortune focused on slow-paced, defensive play behind a large weapon or greatshield, which deals poise damage passively when deflecting, but cannot perform guard counters. It can be obtained by rooting out a deserter knight near the Ailing Village in the Weeping Peninsula.

- Added a new legendary fortune, the Fortune of the Reeds. It is a fortune focused on an action-packed deflect play style with a light sword or great katana, rewarding honed gameplay with better stamina management. It can be obtained by defeating the Bell-Bearing Hunter at the Isolated Merchant's Shack in Greyoll's Dragonbarrow.

## Map
- Updated the Land of Shadows map with all of ERR's new map features, including:
  - 30 map icons for all the new bosses

- Fixed an issue where VFX from Red Wolf's Gambol could appear in place of a mimicked object in Weeping Peninsula.

- Promised Consort: Fixed multiple issues with unjumpable attacks and invisible hitboxes, decreased the tracking on some clone attacks, and decreased the size of most sword hitboxes.

Updated to regulation version 1.13.1, for compatibility with the latest ELDEN RING update.

Fixed an issue that made certain new ERR enemies not take any damage from the DoT effects of Destined Death, Black Flame, or Fire. This bug was caused by a new DLC property on enemies that controls the rate at which certain effects damage them.

Applied this scaling effect properly to the Blight status damage, Revenant Heal damage, Haligbone arrow effect, Angel's Wing skill, Poison Moth Flight skill, Magma affinity effect, and Night Maiden's Mist damage. These damage sources will now scale more effectively on lower health enemies, especially one's such as Night Maiden's Mist which can easily damage lots of enemies at the same time, but had limited usefulness against weak mobs due to a lack of damage scaling between weak mobs and bosses.

The Ruptured Crystal Tear now scales with weapon level, up to 5x damage at +25.

Updated the categories in the Codex of the All-Knowing in preparation for DLC additions.

Fixed an issue where Glintstone Dragon Smarag was overleveled for its location.

Fixed an issue where certain animations could appear jittery at times, and transitioning to idle state from certain Reforged weapons would appear incorrectly for female characters.

Fixed an issue where some SFX changes (like player light) were lost about 2 months ago.

Removed the rune cost of leveling Spirit Ashes. (I really just forgot to do this a while ago.)

Version 0.13.46

Updated the Fortune and Palette menus to work while in a multiplayer session in the new Seamless Coop versions.

Added some incantation school that are buffed by the Fortune of the Sage.

Added the ability for the Thunderous Beast Charm's lightning explosion (and any potential future abilities like this) to increase its damage with the players weapon level.

Fixed an issue causing missing textures on the Magnetic Ore materials in the world.

Improved Ancient Dragon Lightning Strike by slowing down the rate at which the bolts travel and making the spell linger for a longer duration, as well as reducing the random spread of the bolts.

Fixed an issue where the previous patches patch note of "The recovery stacking reduction effect will no longer affect direct heals as much." accidentally decreased the amount of healing received instead of increasing it.

Version 0.13.45

Lower level weapons will now consume less stamina. Weapons at +0 now consume 25% less stamina, while weapons at max reinforcement will consume the current amount. This also applies to spells and spell catalysts. This will help players from feeling the need to rush leveling endurance at low levels, while keeping the desired level of endruance for a complete build the same.

Fixed an issue with the Great Turtle Shell that made its icon sometimes flicker when held on the back. Also fixed a text issue in its description.

Fixed an issue where Weapon Catalysts would not correctly cast after certain actions.

Fixed Prayerful Strike not providing healing on hit.

Fixed an issue where Sacred Seals were erroneously able to perform a guard counter.

Fixed a broken icon on the Horseback boosting effect of the Nightrider weapons.

Version 0.13.43

Removed Erd Tools from the optional DLL folder due to the DLL file unfortunately being flagged by antiviruses. This is a false positive, the file is not malicious, however it causes issues when releasing new Reforged updates. If you wish to use ErdTools, please grab it straight from the author's NexusMods page, but replace the INI file with the one we left in the "dll\optional" folder.

Fixed several issues with Perfect Attack windows, such as when ducking or jump casting.

Restored the flowing mane of Azash, Pride of the Redmanes. Great thanks to The12thAvenger for his FlverFixup tool thas has repaired the bugs with Azash's hair physics.

Recontextualized the names of the "Equip Load" states into a new set of words that better reflect their nature: Nimble Frame, Balanced Frame, Solid Frame and Massive Frame, as a reminder that Solid and even Massive Frame are perfectly viable playstyles.

Fixed the Discus of Light animation so that it can Perfect Attack more easily at lower cast speeds.

Version 0.13.42A

Updated the Reforged Launcher to support loading additional cosmetic mods. The README has been expanded with an "ADDING ADDITIONAL MODS" section which explains how to use the new "addons" folder.

Added a "goodies" folder to the "optional" folder containing ERR graphics, icons and banners, and for making Reforged-related media.

Also updated the Codex of the All-Knowing with a new spread of categories.

Balanced how grease and weapon buff effects are applied to weapons of different speeds. Since most weapon buffs apply a flat amount of damage or status buildup, this amount now scales with the class of weapon. Slower weapons have a higher multiplier on these buffs compared to smaller weapons, ranging from 1.2x effectiveness for colossal weapons down to 0.8x effectiveness for daggers.

Changed the function of rare item drops from enemies. Instead of a fixed percentage chance, each unique item's drop chance gradually increases with every kill that could have resulted in a drop, but didn't.

Golden Runes and above have been replaced with higher-yield variants during New Game+, with the increase falling off towards Lord's Rune.

Holding the Guard input while performing a Light Attack while powerstancing or using paired weapons will now perform a one-handed light attack. Let go of the Guard input to perform the expected dual-wielding attack.

Fixed an issue where the Ornamental Straight Sword paired mode was unable to guard after attacks.

Fixed an issue where the Twinblade Talisman was not affecting powerstanced attacks.

Adjusted stamina regen during attacks and other regeneration-slowing animations to always resume its full effect by the time you would be allowed to move.

Updated the Vulgar Militia Shotel weapon to be a Reaper class weapon instead of a Halberd. This means it no longer shares the weapon category of the Vulgar Militia Saw, and makes it a unique as the only Reaper without innate status.

Renamed the Nightmaiden's Edge to Night's Edge, and the Pumpkin Head Sledgehammer to Pumpkin Sledge.

Updated the balancing on some spirit ashes:
- Rotten Stray: Increased the size of the bite hitboxes for the spirit summon only, so it misses less against weirdly shaped enemies.
- Claymen: Now have the special perk of not taking increased damage when enraged.
- Increased the enraged damage of the Ancestral Follower, Kaiden Warrior, Starcallers, Page, and Raya Lucaria Soldier ashes.
- Fixed an oversight that made the Haligtree Footsoldiers the strongest ashes in the game.

Increased the duration of the Radahn's Rain skill and improved the consistency of the damage. Also fixed an issue where the Radahn's Rain skill lasted for a shorter amount of time and was weaker when using with Golem's Magic Arrows or Radahn's Spears.

The Blood Loss status now has its damage increased by 10% after every activation on a target, stacking for each activation. This gives it the unique property of countering the status resistance increase enemies get after being afflicted with a status.

Altered the area progression of the Leyndell streets and lower Leyndell sections of the Royal Capital by adding some one-way gates to where the Avenue Balcony site of grace originally was.

Decreased the damage tick rate of the fire breath attacks of Dragons and Godrick to only hit once every 2 seconds instead of every 1 second. This will make it much less likely that these attacks hit twice after knocking the player down.

Updated the Codex with Mossy Guardian Golems, Yellow Miranda Blossoms, and Spotted Miranda Blossoms. Also fixed some broken item drop pages for the Mirage Cat Imp and Mirage Twinsage Sorcerer B.

Added a new "Challenges" sub-menu to the Reforged options menu, which now contains the Aggressive Scaling setting as well as a new Forced Combat setting.

The Forced Combat setting disables most interactable prompts, including fog walls, when in combat. This means players will be forced to kill or sneak past enemies in many situations.

Fixed a critical bug that prevented the Launcher from starting.

Downgraded the ModEngine 2 version to preview4, as this seems to have better compatibility with some users.

Forgotten patch note: Updated player HP values to be x2 as large they were before the update. Enemies will deal twice as much damage and healing effects will heal for twice as much, so the effective player HP is unchanged. This change is to improve passive health regen effects that were reduced due to rounding, and also puts the health values at a more fitting value compared to FP and stamina.

Version 0.12.5

More Launcher improvements:
- Moved the launcher files into the "internals" folder.

  - Thanks to Nordgaren for the DLL folder detection code.
- Added AdjustTheFov, RemoveChromaticAberration, RemoveVignette and ErdTools by Nordgaren as optional DLLs.

Version 0.12.2A

Fixed a "toml is read only" error from version 0.12.2.

Version 0.12.2

More Launcher improvements:
- Improved Launcher compatibility with non-Steam installations.
- The Launcher will now prompt you to run Steam if it's not running.
- The Launcher tries to find and report issues with Administrator Mode.
- The Launcher tries to skip Seamless Coop if it is version 2.0.0 (which is incompatible).
- The Launcher no longer waits for key press to proceed in case of warnings.
- The Launcher prints a tidy list of warnings at the end of the output if any warnings were produced. This list is also printed as a "warnings.log" file.

Version 0.12.1A

Improvements to the Launcher:
- The Launcher will clarify if you have multiple save folders, and try to filter out backup copy folders.
- The Launcher will notify you about Elden Mod Loader and its potential consequences.
- The Launcher will notify you if you don't have a save folder, and need to launch ELDEN RING on Steam at least once.

Version 0.12.1

Reintroduced the Launcher EXE "Launch ELDEN RING Reforged.exe". Please use it instead of the shortcut.

Features of the Reforged Launcher EXE:
- Automatically bundles all DLL mods in the "dll" folder
- Locates and adds your installation of Seamless Coop
- Prompts you to create a new ERR save file (if not yet existing)
- Runs Gideon (if not yet ran)

This should hopefully address the technicalities and various issues around running the mod.

Information for players in Japan:

There are currently bugs with the Alt Saves DLL that cause it to malfunction on Japanese game copies. Please remove the Alt Saves DLL file from the DLL folder to launch the mod, until a fix is made.

Use Erd Tools or Seamless Coop to change your save extension to "err".

Information for existing players:

If you're using an existing setup from before 0.12.0, you can feel free to use it. To fix existing Metis Mod Launcher or ModEngine 2 setups, you probably just need to change the mod folder path. The main ERR files are now in the "mod" subfolder instead of directly in the main ERR folder. Simply adjust your setup to make up for this, and add the Transmog DLL from the DLL folder.

Updated the Transmog DLL mod to version 2.2.4.

Implemented some changes that should hopefully improve the consistency of Nomadic Merchant's offering their Supply Pledges.

Decreased all enemy poise damage values by 1. This will improve the poise thresholds and make them much simpler to understand. The 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, etc poise thresholds will now require you to hit that number instead of 1 above. For example, 50 poise will now poise through basic enemy attacks instead of needing 51. This will also greatly improve certain hyper armor frames that gave exactly 50 or 100 minimum poise.

Greatly increased the hitbox size of the Fell Flame Lariat Unique Skill to improve it's consistency and overall damage.

Fixed the Smoldering Shield's scaling.

Perfect Attacks will no longer trigger, or show a window, at 0 stamina.

Slightly increased the opacity of the Perfect Attack window visual.

NPCs will no longer perform Perfect Attacks.

Fixed an issue where broken perfect attack effects were added to certain bow and catalyst attacks. We will be looking at adding a type of perfect attacks to these weapons in the future, but the current implementation was unintended and very broken.

Version 0.12.0D

Replaced the Launch ELDEN RING Reforged.exe file with a simple shortcut file so anti-viruses don't flag it as malicious.

Temporarily removed the Controller Prompt options from the UI setup due to bugs.

Fixed some issues that could make the new Giant Blacksmith not able to be interacted with.

Fixed a missing sound on the Fell Thorn Stake running R1s.

Fixed the stat requirements of some weapons that got modified scaling in version 0.12.0.

Fixed another typo.

Version 0.12.0B

Fixed a typo.

Version 0.12.0

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Reforged UI Setup" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Significantly simplified the process of running the mod by bundling an installation of ModEngine2 with the mod folder.

For most users, they may now simply run the "Launch ELDEN RING Reforged" executable in the mod folder in order to launch the mod.

By default, Reforged comes with the following DLLs:
- "Elden Ring Alt Saves" by chainfailure (set to save file extension .err)
- "Elden Ring Title Skip" by chainfailure
- "Transmogrify Armor" by Tom Clark
- "Unlock the FPS" and "Ultrawide Fix" by TechieW (with fixes by Nordgaren)

The README.txt was updated with information on how to launch the mod with this new setup.

Added new README files with information on how to make Linux/Steam Deck, and the Randomizer, work with Reforged.

Added language support for Traditional Chinese (translated by Po). Please note that newly added languages will not contain translations for content added in the same update.

Added two new weapons: the Fellthorn Stake and the Fellthorn Clutches.
- The Fellthorn Stake is a Fell-affinity somber Colossal Weapon with Fire damage, Bloodloss buildup and a unique skill: Fell Flame Flare.
- The Fellthorn Clutches is a Fell-affinity somber Fists Weapon Catalyst which strengthens fire incantations and has a unique skill: Fell Flame Lariat.

Added a new boss encounter: the Fellthorn Spirit. Tortured by Giantsflame, these avatars of the Erdtree are subjected to cruelest agony by the cardinal sin.
- A Fellthorn Spirit can be found on Flame Peak, rewarding the Fell Thorn Stake upon defeat.
- Another Fellthorn Spirit may be found in Leyndell, Ashen Capital, replacing the Ulcerated Tree Spirits. It rewards the Fell Thorn Clutches upon defeat.

Integrated Tom Clark's Transmogrify Armor mod into Reforged. The transmog menu can be found in the "Alter garments" option at a Site of Grace. You need to own a piece of armor for it to become available as transmog.

Added Supply Pledges to nomadic merchants. Upon buying out a nomadic merchant's inventory, you may claim their Supply Pledge. Holding a Supply Pledge expands Merchant Kalé's shop inventory with the issuing merchant's unlimited items at an additional discount, offering a central shop without bloodshed, and at a bargain.

Added an unlimited stock of a crafting ingredient to each nomadic merchant. These stocks are carried over to Kalé via Supply Pledge.

Added a new nomadic merchant in Deeproot Depths, accessible down a rocky hole near the Prince of Death area entrance.

Added a reclusive blacksmith to the back area of Castle Sol who sells Golem Greatarrows and Magic Golem Greatarrows.

Endurance now increases stamina recovery speed as well as maximum stamina, scaling up to +120 stamina regeneration at 99 Endurance. 

Added Perfect Attacks. Performing a follow-up attack input at the precise time it becomes available causes the attack to have <BONUS> and <BONUS>. Perfect Attacks can be performed after previous attacks, or after defensive actions. Mashing the attack button before the Perfect Attack window waives the bonus. Perfect Attack visuals may be toggled at a Site of Grace.

Reworked the way some personal Reforged settings are applied. Settings such as "Left-hand block" and "Perfect attack visuals" are now deposited as items in the player's inventory, allowing them to be properly networked via multiplayer.

Wielding the sword in the right hand, and the spear in the left, enables a new guarding stance with increased guard boost, a new unique Guard Counter, and the ability to use left-hand spear attacks by inputting Guard + Light Attack. The Cleanrot Spear's Sacred Phalanx skill will now also override any right-hand skills, allowing it to be used in this weapon combo.

Perfect Deflects will now consume a small amount of stamina. This cost cannot cause guardbreaks, but it can prevent 0 stamina Guard Counters.

Flame, Cleanse Me now additionally purges stains and swamp buildup from your body, akin to Soap.

Fixed the Crystal Staff R2 not regenerating any FP.

Increased the healing done by various healing-over-time effects. However, stacking healing-over-time effects will now have diminishing returns. This makes single sources of healing more worthwhile while keeping their stacked effectiveness in line. Stacking healing will, of course, still be more effective than using any buff alone, just slightly less so.

Added the Beryl Hood, an Endurance equivalent of the Crimson and Navy Hoods. It can be obtained by looting an unfortunate corpse on the plateaus south of the Bestial Sanctum, in the Dragonbarrow.

The first kill of a Remembrance boss in a playthrough will now grant 1.5x more runes.

Added a Grasp of Eochaid reference to the Elemer's grab attack.

Increased the animation speed of the shield grease item.

Updated "mist" attacks to tick only once per second instead of twice, making them cause enemies to flinch less often and overall be less annoying to use.

Fixed some issues with translations that would cause Fortune descriptions to be missing.

Added a "randomizer_merge_config.yml" from the latest version of the enemy and item randomizer that should prevent Rune Pieces from being randomized, and a few other things.

Version 0.11.96B

Fixed spirit ashes.

Version 0.11.96A

Confirmed that multiplayer difficulties can still work with the changes in 0.11.96. Enemy scaling is now disabled by default in Seamless to avoid usses. Remember to always have the same difficulty set for all players to avoid bugs.

Welcoming a new team member: Cavou. Cavou will be performing quality assurance, and has thus far addressed more than several dozen clipping, floating and positioning issues with map assets around the world. Further down the line, Cavou may also do map additions of his own.

Reduced the cost of Somber Smithing Stones from 12x (matching regular SS) to 10x (matches regular SS prices better as Sombers have the additional tier 9 stone to buy).

Version 0.11.95

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Overhauled the player experience surrounding the Fortune system.

- As in the previous update, the significance of each effect is highlighted with an adjective like "vastly" or "slightly".

Added three new Basic Fortunes, one for each Fortune category: the Fortune of the Bold, the Fortune of the Wise, and the Fortune of the Cunning.
- Basic Fortunes are always available to all characters, and have simple, weak bonuses with a simple downside. This aids players who are overwhelmed by the many mechanics of the Fortune system.
- The Fortune of the Bold increases HP, melee weapon attack damage, and guard effectiveness, while reducing FP.
- The Fortune of the Wise increases FP, spell and catalyst attack damage, and memory slots, while reducing Stamina.
- The Fortune of the Cunning increases stamina, ranged weapon and consumable attack damage, and buff duration, while reducing HP.

- Artificer was renamed to Apothecary.
- Warlock was renamed to Heretic.
- Paladin was renamed to Sentinel.

Added four new spells:
- Eclipse Blade: A weapon buff sorcery that applies deathblight buildup to weapons, and holy damage scaling off of intelligence and faith. It drops from the Mausoleum Knight outside of the Black Knife Catacombs.
- Briars of Resentment: A bloodthorn sorcery that creates a field of briars, dealing continuous damage and blood loss buildup over time. It can be found on a corpse in the Altus Plateau, on a hidden ledge beneath the Bridge of Iniquity.
- Projection of Gold: An erdtree incantation that fires off an explosive projectile, staggering enemies in a large area. It drops from a new Tree Sentinel miniboss on the Bridge of Sacrifice.
- Dragonlord's Domain: A dragon communion incantation gained through the Rememberance of the Dragonlord, it staggers all surrounding enemies and slows their flow of time, making them move at a glacial speed and deal significantly less damage for a short duration.

Increased the area of effect of Greyoll's Roar. Updated the Placidusax's Ruin icon to include a Dragon Communion scroll to match the others.

Added more unique effects to the generic attack boosting talismans, in addition to their original effects:

- Axe Talisman: Slightly increases the charge speed of charged R2 attacks.
- Curved Sword Talisman: Provides damage negation while guard countering.
- Claw Talisman: Provides increased poise while jump attacking.
- Lance Talisman: Now buffs spells and projectiles fired from horseback at a reduced rate.
- Greatshield Talisman: Decreases the stamina penalty from holding the guard stance.

Updated Weapon Catalysts. Weapon Catalysts must now be worn in the main hand to serve as catalyst. To spellcast with a weapon catalyst, you must now use the Light Attack input (R1) while guarding (L1). Enable "Left-Hand Block" in the Reforged settings to enable Weapon Catalyst casting while powerstancing or holding non-shield offhand weapons.
- This means you can now guard and deflect while using Weapon Catalysts.

- Added a status icon to the Ranger's stamina cost down buff and increased its duration.
- Swapped the Wizard and Sorcerer fortune FP cost down and max FP up buffs. The Sorcerer now naturally decreases Sorcery FP costs, while the Wizard naturally increases maximum FP. This makes the Wizard usable with incantations, only missing a slight damage boost.
- The Cleric now provides movement speed increases and bubble shields to the caster when using self targeting incantations.
- Improved the consistency of the Warlock's restoration buff.
- Increased the duration of the Spellsword buff.

Added PvP specific damage modifiers to nerf whips, some rancor spells, and the first R1 attack of daggers.

Fixed an issue that caused Torrent to revert to a previously bugged state where the sprint state wouldn't fully cancel when letting go of a direction.

Enemy item drop updates:

- Added magic material drops to Raya Lucaria Scholars.
- Added perfume material drops to pages.

Decreased the hitbox size of the randomly spreading ground fire in Godrick's second phase.

Added a new accessibility settings menu with a new option. The option allows the player to obtain an infinite amount of blue and orange paint pots, throwable items that color an enemy in their hue, making some hard to see enemies more accessible for colorblind players.

Added some net sync fixes that fix ERR's compatibility with (unreleased) regular co-op. This may or may not also improve connections in Seamless Co-op, idk.

Version 0.11.8C

Fixed a minor issue with a certain level of player stagger animation taking slightly longer to roll out of than intended.

Fixed the Coil Shield.

Version 0.11.8

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Welcoming two new team members: poeconcept and hanalove.

- Moved the location of the Broken Straight Sword.
- Clarified in the Stance-Breaking tutorial that it may be wise to change weapons (to meet the threshold for the tutorial enemies).
- Changed the exit portal at the end to appear upon the Soldier of Godrick's defeat, rather than upon defeat of the Knights of the First Lord boss phase.
- Added a new imp statue and tutorial pop up before the Knights of the First Lord to inform the player that the fight difficulty is higher than the rest of the tutorial, and that they can leave the dungeon early.

Added a small section to the "Materials" tutorial to inform the player that materials respawn upon sitting at a Site of Grace.

Fixed an issue in the Gilded Cave of Knowledge which caused a major game freeze when entering a certain area.

Added a new boss: Grave Sentinel Wyngrant, a dismounted Tree Sentinel.
- Model by hanalove.

Boss healthbars are now split into 10 segments of 10% HP, separated by small notches.

Added the weapon wielded by each Tree Sentinel in the name of the Tree Sentinel duo bosses. Also fixed the Beastman of Farum Azula being named (Throwing Knife) instead of (Chakram).

Fixed a vanilla issue where the Tree Sentinel and Runebear had melee attacks that would hit and deal damage twice. This issue affects many enemies in vanilla, mostly on attacks that slam into the ground and create AoE damage, resulting in the the melee hitbox and AoE hitbox both hitting the player at the same time.

Fixed a vanilla issue where many NPCs had incorrect equip load tiers for how armored they were. Heavily armored NPCs like Adan will no longer have light load, but medium or even heavy load states.

Fixed issues in Redmane Castle where certain enemies had too great of a hearing range and would approach from further away than intended.

Fixed the map markers for the Fell Twins and Godskin Duo bosses not appearing.

Added HP scaling to Torrent based on player level. Torrent will now scale from its current health value up to 2x HP at level 200, gaining 5% more HP every 10 levels. Also fixed the long-standing vanilla bug where Torrent would not heal between loading screens or when resting at Sites of Grace.

Increased the recovery speed of the knockdown animation that plays when falling off Torrent.

Added a small to medium amount of hyper armor to the following spell cast animations:

Updated the Fortune of the Warmaster to grant 5 favored weapons (3 when equipped as a minor fortune) instead of 3 favored weapons (1 when minor).

Reduced the counter damage penalty in PvP and balanced the damage modifier of some spells and attacks in PvP.

Disabled rune arcs and spirit ash summoning in the PvP difficulty due to bugs.

Added Thai translation. Many thanks to BazAKu. This happened a while ago, and we neglected to mention it in the update notes.

Updated Gideon to v2.3.1.0, which fixes some issues and speeds up the Setup UI Images process.

Established parity between ERR texts and 1.10 Vanilla texts, and fixed some typos and text issues.

Version 0.11.6B

Fixed the Site of Grace list on the Map Menu having incomplete Enemy Level text. This patch note was also missed in the update. The Site of Grace menu that can be accessed on the Map now has more subcategories per area, listing the level of enemies in each subcategory.

Version 0.11.6

Doubled the status resistance values of the player, while doubling the amount of status buildup enemies deal. This will keep status buildup the same against enemies, while making it easier to fight NPCs who use status effects. The larger resistance value also means that your status bars are visually larger, making it easier to see them appear on the side of the screen.

Increased the damage scaling of crossbows gained through reinforcement from 4.5x to 5x. Added slight scaling to crossbows that only applies to elemental damage.

Increased the poise damage of most arrows and bolts by 10-20%. Increased the stamina damage of arrows and bolts from 5 to 20-30 depending on the projectile. These increases stack with the multiplicative increases of skills like Mighty Shot and Enchanted Shot.

Changed the Pulley Bow and Golem Greatbow from Somber bows to regular bows.

Increased the stagger level of direct hits with Ballista Bolts to be stronger than Great Arrows.

Removed affinities from regular bows, as they were generally buggy and unbalanced.

Added the Fire and Night affinity effects to Fire/Flaming Arrows/Bolts and Dwelling/Meteor Arrows/Bolts.

Added Arcane scaling to the Ivory Sickle.

Adjusted the weight of the Flowing Curved Sword and Blue Cloth Set so that the player can light load when using both together.

Version 0.11.5C

Version 0.11.5B

Fixed issues with the generation of Beasthood when using the Fortune of the Beasts.

Version 0.11.5

Added a new legendary fortune, the Fortune of the Beasts. It is a Fortune focused on Bestial abilities and Beasthood, similar to the mechanic from Bloodborne. Using any bestial spell or skill will build Beasthood, with some abilities giving it in unique ways. It can be obtained by feeding Gurranq all of the Deathroot.

Added a new boss encounter, the Fulminating Runebear. It can be found in the Fulgurbloom patch east of Testu's Rise, in Liurnia of the Lakes.

Added two new talismans:
- The Thunderous Beast Charm enhances running speed and running attacks with an explosive lightning flourish. It can be found by defeating the Fulminating Runebear.
- The Execrable Serpent's Exultation reacts to poison in the vicinity and increases your status buildup dealt to nearby enemies. It can be found by challenging a new camp at the Leyndell Colosseum to righteous combat.

The artwork for both talismans was contributed by poeconcept, host of the Reforged Duelists PvP event and contributor of the Goldvine Branchstaff model.

Moved the Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook [2] (Lightning Pot recipe) to the site of an unbearable tragedy east of Testu's Rise in Liurnia of the Lakes. Its former location in Altus Plateau has been replaced by a merchant note to inform of this change.

Adjusted stat scaling. Endurance now gives 1100 stamina at 30 instead of 1000, and Vigor now gives 2400 HP at 99 instead of 2500.

Adjusted the crafting recipes of some pots to require slightly less materials.

The Oil Pot effect will now linger for an additional second after the first instance of fire damage, benefitting multi-hit attacks such as Flame, Fall Upon Them. Additionally, hitting wet enemies (in rain or water) with an Oil Pot will now permanently negate their wetness fire resistance bonus.

Decreased the power of some long-lasting spells in PvP only.

Added a unique effect to the Bloodhound Knight Floh spirit ash to fit its aggressive nature. Floh will now spawn immediately enraged, consuming the additional FP cost automatically.

Updated the visual effects of the Burial Watchdogs who use Frenzyflame attacks, with updated visual effects made by the modder Rayan.

Fixed a bug that made the God-Devouring Serpent unkillable.

Made various updates to status icons:
- Progressing buff effects are now marked with Roman numerals in the style of Lies of P, with the final stage marked by a slight glow.
- Updated the status icons for the Artificer buff and the plunge attack bonus.
- Improved the display of Spellsword buffs.
- Improved the display of Minor Fortune buffs.

Added an on-screen prompt to show how to Guard Counter during the "Deflect and Guard Counter" section of the tutorial.

Fixed various issues with the translation.

Fixed a randomizer error with the Stranded Graveyard.

Fixed some typos.

Version 0.11.2A

Mitigated a Seamless Co-op issue that would cause the Maliketh phase 2 cutscene to play when resting at a Site of Grace in Farum Azula by adding a requirement that the player actually be in the boss room for the cutscene to play.

Moved the surrounded passive effect on the Champion Set again, to the Eccentric's Set.

Reduced HP recovery in PvP.

Fixed the Page set's passive effect showing the wrong status icon.

Fixed the "Unlock Sites of Grace" and "Unlock Recipes" settings on the debug menu.

Version 0.11.2

Updated the Baldachin's Blessing to provide a unique potential benefit instead of being a direct nerf when in the player's inventory. It will now decrease the player's HP by 10% instead of the original 5%, but also provides a 10% equip load boost as well. This helps give more customization and equip load options to the player.

Howl of Shabriri's attack buff will now consistently apply to its own hitboxes, and the spell will hit a consistent amount of times. Also slightly increased the animation speed of the spell.

Fixed some issues with Unendurable Frenzy that made it able to deal way more damage than intended, but greatly improved the consistency of the spells hitboxes and increased the animation speed.

Increased the animation speed and tracking of the Ground Slam skills.

Moved the Brave's set damage negation passive effect to the Champion Set. The Brave's Set passive effect now enhances roar attacks, like the Highland Axe effect. 

Added text explaining the hidden passive of the Omen Set that only buffs the Shriek of Milos. Updated the vanilla text of the Royal Remains passive effect to be more accurate to what the effect does.

Made some PvP specific changes:
- Added an alternate deflect for PvP, which only blocks 100% of physical damage on perfect deflects.
- Reduced the buildup of blight and blood loss.
- Increased the FP cost of skills.
- Fixed an issue that made poise slightly more effective than intended.

Added a "Rest" button to the debug menu which restores HP, FP, Flasks, and the Physik.

Fixed an issue with the "Setup UI Images" shortcut that could rarely happen for some users with misconfigured PATH variables.

Fixed some typos.

Version 0.11.1B

Fixed an issue that made Special difficulties inaccessible.

Version 0.11.1A

Smithing stones can now be purchased earlier. For example, Smithing Stone [1]s can now be purchased after reinforcing a weapon to +3 instead of the previous requirement of +6. The price of smithing stones has gone up slightly to account for this change, and smithing stone conversion via the crafting menu has been removed.

Added some missing Great Ghost Gloveworts to lategame areas like Farum Azula and the Mountaintops of the Giants.

Fixed an issue that broke the AI of the Astel bosses.

Fixed an issue that made NPC enemies sometimes freeze.

Fixed the "Body Hues" tutorial reappearing when participating in NPC invasions.

Fixed some situations where the Spirit-Severing Blade or Spirit Fury mechanic could be used without an active spirit.

Fixed an issue with the Forlorn Hound's Evergaol map marker.

Fixed an issue that made Azash reward less runes than intended when defeated.

Fixed some minor text issues.

Version 0.11.1

Increased the damage Crucible Knight Rhyacis takes when an attack is successfully dodged from 6% to 7%.

Added a "return to entrance" mini-grace to signify that the cave is exitable if the player cannot beat the boss.

Added a new status icon to signify that the Aggressive Scaling option is enabled.

Adjusted some PvP mode specific settings:
- I-frames should now properly block status buildup when the PvP difficulty is selected.
- Guard counters and the kick skill now deal more stamina and poise damage.
- Poise is now greatly reduced for a short duration after being guardbroken.
- Decreased the damage of some faster thrown darts.

Fixed a bug that broke the text of the sword monuments.

Added a super secret debug menu.

Version 0.11.0D

Adjusted the bounds of the collision of the Cave of Knowledge boss room to minimize loading freezes near the Stranded Graveyard until the issue can be fixed. This mainly fixes a freeze when fighting near the Tree Sentinel.

Version 0.11.0B

Improved the usability of the Fire Surge and Grasp of Eochaid cast animation by allowing roll cancels while channeling the spell.

Decreased the tick rate of the "surrounded" type buff to improve performance and mitigate some unintended interactions.

Fixed an issue with the included CHANGELOG.txt file.

Version 0.11.0A

Improved the performance in the Stranded Graveyard by reducing the amount of areas that load the outside overworld.

The game will freeze for a few seconds when entering specific areas in the Stranded Graveyard. This is a known issue that will be resolved when the right modding tools are available.

Fixed a clipping asset at the entrance to the Fringefolk Hero's Grave.

Fixed another, totally separate issue that broke the Yelough Anix Tunnel if attempted after burning the Erdtree.

Fixed a broken ladder in Farum Azula.

Fixed the Exploration difficulty still opening the "Hard effects" tutorial page.

Fixed the sorting of the Limgrave boss resurrection menu.

Version 0.11.0

The Cave of Knowledge has been redesigned into a Reforged tutorial experience, the Gilded Cave of Knowledge. The dungeon features a new visual identity and encounters tailored to teach the player how to interact with the most important Reforged changes. Clearing the cave, and its new boss encounter, rewards the Brave's armor set.

Hard difficulties are now locked behind clearing the Gilded Cave of Knowledge. For players who want to quickly begin runs, Quick Start will automatically unlock them.

Added a status icon to display the currently selected difficulty. Normal mode is exempt from this and will not display an icon.

Reforged tutorials are now marked by a Reforged icon to distinguish them from vanilla tutorials, and have been furnished with unique images. Various adjustments to tutorial texts were also made.

Added Reforged hint messages. New messages glowing in an orange hue will now be present in several locations around the world to mark significant Reforged departures from the base game, or to give hints how to tackle new content. These messages can be toggled off in Reforged settings at Sites of Grace.

Fringefolk Hero's Grave is now (once again) locked behind 2 Stonesword Keys, and the boss encounter has been changed to a Banished Knight.

Added new graphics to indicate that the "Setup UI Images" shortcut hasn't been run. These graphics appear in place of Reforged tutorial images, and during the loading process of icons in the detailed item description view. Running the shortcut will remove these graphics and restore regular appearance (until the mod is updated, upon which the shortcut must be run again).
----------

Added new, magical heavy attacks for Staves and Seals. The heavy attacks are comprised of short to medium-range spells that restore FP and allow for limited movement, uniquely flavored for each catalyst. As these are R2/heavy attacks, they deal poise damage at a higher rate than actual damage. There are a total of 24 new attacks across all Staves and Seals.

Added two new spells:
- Raving Rancor: A death sorcery that sets up a skull to fire a beam of ghostflame. Obtained by defeating the 4 special, skeleton-summoning Bloodbane Albinaurics in the Moghwyn Palace outskirts.
- Grasp of Eochaid: An uncategorized incantation that saps vitality from foes, restoring HP. Obtained by defeating the Bell-Bearing Hunter in the Capital Outskirts.

Spell balance:
- Carian Piercer: Reduced animation end lag.
- Surge, O Flame!: Increased poise damage, hitbox size, and range.
- Urgent Heal: Increased the amount of HP restored, but also increased the FP cost.
- Elden Stars: Increased cast speed, but also increased the FP cost.
- Scarlet Aeonia: Reduced animation end lag and increased camera zoom.
- Flame of Frenzy: Greatly increased the consistency of hitting with the projectiles at close range.

Updated all of the status curing spells to have proper text, status icons, and visual effects for the status resistance increase effects they also provide.

Fixed an issue with Rock Blaster consuming more FP than intended when held, and no FP when not held.

Fixed Bestial Sling sometimes shooting two sets of projectiles when cast while jumping.

Made multiple other minor spell balance adjustments, with minor nerfs and buffs to the damage of many spells to tighten the overall balance.
----------

Added a new "twinblade", the Goldvine Branchstaff, an wooden bo which deals Strike damage using the Godskin Peeler's special twinblade moveset. This weapon increases in power when surrounded by enemies. It is obtained in the Sainted Hero's Grave. The model and icon were contributed by PoeConcept.

Converted the Ivory Sickle, Crystal Knife, and Prince of Death's Staff to Somber Smithing Stone weapons. To maintain compatibility, upgraded versions of these weapons will be reverted to +0 when updating the mod.

Added the vertical colossal sword swings from DS3 to the two-handed R1s for the Greatsword and Ruins Greatsword colossal swords.

Improved moveset transitions for Greataxes.

Fixed some weapon damage types. The Lance now deals Strike damage on its attacks with slashing motions. The Sacred Relic Sword now deals Standard damage like the boss does.

Fixed an issue that would cause left-handed Weapon Catalysts unable to cast when two-handed without Left-Hand Block enabled.

Fixed the Loretta's War Sickle unique buff to Loretta's sorceries not working.

Fixed a missing hitbox on the Golden Slam skill.
----------

Redesigned the Twinblade Talisman to gradually increase the damage of each hit in a light attack combo, in a progression of 1% -> 3% -> 6% -> 12% -> 18% -> 12%, instead of only affecting the final hit in the combo.

Fixed the Red-Feathered Branchsword and Ritual Sword Talisman not working on spells.

Added the following passive effects to armor sets:
- Ancestral Follower Fur Set: Restores FP upon defeating enemies.
- Brave Set: Increases damage negation when surrounded by enemies.
- Gelmir Knight Set: Restores HP upon defeating enemies.

Increased the Barbarian Fortune heal boost when taking damage from 2x to 2.5x.

Increased the duration of the Crucible Fortune aspect buffs from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.

Added the Spirit-Severing Blade, a new item in the Ashes category which allows dismissing currently active Spirit Ashes (since, due to Spirit Fury, that function was lost). The item is awarded along with the Spirit-Calling Bell, and will retroactively be added to existing characters.

Added a Crystal Tears section to the Starlight Token exchange shop.

Increased the cost of purchasing Rune Pieces in NG+, but also increased the amount obtained from multiple bosses. This change is to make farming less of a focus over defeating challenging bosses.
----------
Updated some difficulty settings:
	- Exploration mode no longer has hard enemy effects and bosses are slightly weaker.
	- Harder difficulties with hard enemy effects now includes a small rune decay penalty on death.

Added additional Fell God fire effects to the Stonedigger troll in the Old Altus Tunnel, making it more advanced than the Limgrave Tunnels version of the boss.

Fixed some overpowered NPC enemies and reduced NPC damage absorption to counter the fact that NPCs also received the recent buff to armor effectiveness. Also made it so that NPC enemies who cast spells aren't always casting at maximum cast speed.

Increased the Vigor stat of summonable NPCs to account for this nerf.

Fixed an issue where the codex progression increase gained when killing an enemy could guardbreak the player if an enemy was killed while guarding with 0 stamina remaining.

Added a Stake of Marika to the Abandoned Cave boss fight. Fixed an issue that caused the Stake of Marika outside of Rennala's boss room to not work.

Fixed an issue with a missing hitbox on the Fire and Magic Pots that can be thrown by Cat and Fanged Imps.

Fixed the Spirit-Caller Snail boss of the Road's End Catacombs dropping less runes than intended.

Fixed an issue where the Breath and Horn aspect Crucible Knight enemies did not have the same duo AI limitations as the Tail and Claw aspects (most notable in the Spirit-Caller Snail fight).

Fixed the Poisonous Rotmounds accidentally dealing Rot buildup instead of Poison buildup.

Fixed an issue that broke the AI of the greatshield-wielding Fallen Hawk Soldiers.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Astel bosses to freeze, especially during phase 2.

Fixed a visual issue with Godrick Knights causing their eyes to appear far above their helmet's eye slit when appearing as camp guardians or with the golden rune eyes.

Fixed map marker issues for the Putrid Crystalian Trio and Hallowed Avatar bosses.
----------

Added "Ruin Telescopes" to certain Ruins with some harder to find seals, making it a bit easier to get an overview of the area.

Increased the pick-up radius of recoverable runes to make them easier to recover.

Renamed Summonwater Village to Summonwater Ruins for consistency with other ruins.

Fixed an issue that made a seal at the Yelough Anix Ruins inaccessible if attempted after burning the Erdtree.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Sealed Ruins tutorial message to pop up when far away from any Sealed Ruins.

Fixed some issues with the Codex where HP, poise, and rune values could print incorrectly for certain variants.

Fixed Yura failing to meet the stat requirements for his weapon.

Fixed an issue with the Magnus the Beast Claw invasion where some texts would be missing.

Added a fix to a vanilla/seamless bug that could cause infinite loading screens when warping to the Roundtable Hold while using Seamless Coop.

Fixed an issue that caused the Binding Rune of Tainted Projection to fail to restock when shattered.

Fixed an issue with translations that caused odd spaces to appear.

Fixed minor text issues.

Version 0.10.3

Added a new "Alternate Start" option at the Altar of Anticipation. This option can be selected alongside Quick Start in NG+, and allows you to choose from multiple different starting locations that each have a slight bit of randomness. One site of grace within the selected region will be activated automatically, and multiple regions can be selected at the same time to allow players in NG+ to cut out a lot of the overworld map traversal.

To allow for full traversal of the map from any direction, Magma Wyrm Makar's boss room can now be entered from behind. A Stake of Marika was also added to the boss room, and is active if the back entrance was taken.

Added Stakes of Marika to the Rennala and Red Wolf fights in the Academy of Raya Lucaria as well.

Moved the fog wall blocking the Moonlight Altar if Ranni's quest was not completed. It will now just block the cave entrance to Ranni's Two Fingers.

Removed the Waygate that warps the player to the Dragonkin Soldier of Nokron's upper area of the Siofra River, and replaced it with a path up the stone pillars made of scaffolding and ladders.

Added reusable tool items to the Starlight Token shop.

Reduced the weight and effectiveness of the following armor pieces to be more realistic/fitting:
- Black Knife Hood
- Grave Warden Cloak (Altered)
- Rotten Grave Warden Cloak (Altered)

Added a decreasing chance for NPC enemies to dodge projectiles on reaction every time they succesfully dodge a projectile. If the dodge fails to activate due to this decreasing chance, the chance is increased back to its default value. Also decreased enemy NPC damage by 10% for all NPCs.

Updated the Spiritcaller Snail's rune rewards to match the harder boss fight.

Slightly decreased the chance of the Revenant horse summon animation, depending on the difficulty.

Fixed an issue with the Overloaded state duck animation not working in certain circumstances.

Fixed the Ice Lighting Wisps having yellow lighting hit effects instead of blue.

Fixed Rykard being staggerable in certain animations that should have instead had stagger immunity.

Fixed the Night's Cavalry Duo map marker.

Fixed more bugs in the Eternal Return game mode.

The Staff of Loss text now properly states that it increases the strength of night sorceries, instead of "invisibility" sorceries.

The item description for boluses now fully state what the status effect does.

Version 0.10.2A

Added a slow duck to the Overloaded state.

Removed a small HP recovery penalty on the Fortune of the Barbarian.

Fixed an issue with the Darkness/White Shadow's Lure/Golden Star cast animation where it would not stop stamina recovery.

Added a small chance for cloaked Revenant Followers to summon their horse using an unused animation.

Fixed the broken Imp enemies in Leyndell.

Fixed the Full-Bloom Guardian codex identification outside of the Minor Erdtree Church.

Fixed an issue with some minor enemies being backstabbable on harder difficulties.

Fixed an issue where the final bosses could get inflated stats when the Eternal Return game mode interacted with the enemy scaling mechanic.

Version 0.10.2

Reduced the weight and effectiveness of the following armor pieces to be more realistic/fitting:
- All-Knowing Helmet
- All-Knowing Armor
- All-Knowing Gauntlets
- All-Knowing Greaves
- Aristocrat's Hat
- Bandit Mask
- Bandit Garb
- Bandit Boots
- Black Hood
- Leather Armor
- Leather Gloves

With these changes the Bandit starting class now has light load by default.

Increased the amount of stamina regeneration that is percentage based, making leveling endurance and increasing maximum stamina more impactful.

The Drake Knight armor now strengthens Dragon Communion incantations.

Extended the duration of the Fortune of the Houses buff.

Added a very small amount of damage scaling Arcane to the Poison and Blood affinities.

Added a second phase/enraged state to the Elemer of the Briar boss, making it more advanced than all the various Bell-Bearing Hunters. The lighting of the boss arena has also received an update, and changes during the bosses enraged state.

Deathblight will no longer destroy runes if a Sacrificial Twig is equipped.

Improved the compatibility of Ruins in Seamless Co-op.

Fixed the completion trackers for the Laskyar and Purified Ruins.

Fixed broken Codex events for Lichdragon Fortissax and Dragonlord Placidusax.

Fixed the Mad Pumpkin Head Duo boss entry being in the wrong resurrect menu.

Fixed an issue with Flame, Cleanse Me providing a small amount of healing.

Version 0.10.1J

Fixed Summonwater Village having no seals or completion markers. (I didn't know it had a cellar.)

Fixed a text issue,,,

Version 0.10.1I

Changed the weight multipier applied to armor in 0.10.1 from 1.9x to 1.75x.

Removed the unnecessary weight values from talismans.

Version 0.10.1D

The light load dodge now uses the dodge animation from Bloodborne. The animation's tracking was updated so that the dodge animation feels smoother than it would with a pure animation replacement.

Fixed some issues with equip load states not applying effects properly. The stamina regeneration of the light load state is now slightly faster, and the heavy and overloaded states now have less of a stamina regeneration penalty.

Adjusted the scaling curves of some weapon affinities. 3+ stat affinities should be a bit more effective.

Updated the Glintstone Kris and Varre's Bouquet to use an easier scaling curve that requires less stats.

Fixed an issue that caused the Golden Halberd to not apply its Erdtree incantation damage boost.

Version 0.10.1C

Increased the efficiency of the background thread.

Added the ability to completely disable certain ERR mechanics by deposited the item into the storage box. (Codex, Effigy, Fractured Great Rune, etc.)

Version 0.10.1

Added a new mechanic to the Ruins in the overworld, making accessing the cellar more challenging than simply running down the stairs. Revealing the cellar of a Ruins now requires breaking all the seals placed in and around the area. These seals have an easy to spot visual effect of a glowing blue circle, but require an animation to break, and so are dangerous to interact with while in combat.

The Gatefront Ruins provides an easy to understand example of this mechanic as it only has a single seal placed close to the cellar.

As an extra reward for clearing these more challening Ruins, each cellar chest now contains a smithing stone as well as the original item.

These updated ruins will now track completion on the map. Towers like the Converted Tower and Oridy's Rise will now also track completion status.

Reworked the equip load stat, so that equip load is no longer increased by leveling endurance. Equip load now starts at 100 (equivalent to 50 endurance pre-update) and can only be raised by % based effects like talismans and buffs. The weight and effectiveness of armor has been increased to accommodate this default value, and the heavy load state has been buffed in effectiveness. The exact changes are:
- Default 100 equip load.
- Increased armor weight by 1.9x.
- Increased armor damage negation by 1.2x.
- Heavy load now uses a faster roll animation.
- Overloaded now uses the old heavy roll, and doesn't remove sprinting or jumping.
- The stamina cost of evasive actions (rolling, ducking, jumping) now increases with heavier equip load states.
These changes increase the number of viable equip load states and gives each of them their own identity based on the level of armor worn instead of having it be something you just outlevel with endurance.

Modified weapon stats to further incentivize leveling damage stats and to make weapons closer to catalysts and consumables in how important scaling is. The exact changes are:
- Increased weapon scaling by 1.5x.
- Decreased weapon base damage by 1.3x
This change gives weapons the same potential damage as before but requires more stat investment, like catalysts and consumables already do. This creates a more interesting trade off when choosing to level vigor instead of damage stats, something melee characters cared about a lot less than casters.

Gravitational weapons now all have a small amount of non-scaling magic damage to allow them to use the gravity hit visual effect.

Added more enemy variants to the Codex, including Snowfield Man-bats, Crowned Operatic Bats, Sheep variants, and other forms of Imps. With the large increase to the amount of enemy variants in the Codex since it was initially created, the rewards from the Codex have been updated to award 10 Starlight Tokens every 20% of the Codex completed instead of every 25%.

Updated the Spiritcaller Snail boss in the Road's End Catacombs to be more formidable. Defeating atleast a few of the summoned Knights is now required.

Added more variety to the Imp enemies found throughout the game. The mask worn by Imps is now determined by the area they are found in, and affects some of their stats:
- Limgrave: Cat Imps. Throws weighty stones and drops cave moss.
- Liurnia: Fanged Imps. Throws magic pots and drops crystal buds. Resistant to magic damage.
- Caelid: Wolf Imps. Throws fire pots and drops smoldering butterflies. Resistant to fire damage.
- Altus: Corpse Imps. Throws lightning pots and drops altus blooms. Resistant to lightning damage.
- Mountaintops: Elder Imps. Throws holy water pots and drops golden centipedes. Resistant to holy damage.
- Shunning-grounds: Long-Tongue Imps. Throws swarm pots and drops blood-tainted excrement. Resistant to status effects.
	
The Writhing Rotmound enemies have been updated to deal the status effect of the status each variant is themed after.

Godrick Soldiers in the Stormhill area can now use their unused Storm Blade weapon skill.

Fixed boss map marker issues for:
- Ancient Dragon Lansseax
- Mad Pumpkin Head
- Mad Pumpkin Head Duo

Fixed the Frozen Lightning Wisp spell counting as a sorcery for certain casting buffs instead of an incantation.

Fixed a softlock that could happen when attempting to open the Codex on a moving platform.

Version 0.10.0C

Fixed a randomizer compatability error involving an error message for event 16002695.

Fixed a vanilla issue where the Wakizashi description would spill over into the Ash of War description.

Fixed an issue with Godrick the Grafted's map marker.

Fixed an issue with Esgar, Priest of Blood's rune rewards.

Fixed some more minor text issues.

Fixed an issue where exchanging the Rememberance of the Lichdragon for Starlight Tokens would make the Fortissax's Lightning Spear spell unpurchasable even with a duplicated Rememberance.

Fixed the new Spirit Ashes being missing from the Starlight Token shop.

Potentially fixed some issues with Margit's dagger hitboxes.

Added a new crafting recipe for turning Dewkissed Herba into Essential Alchemic. Added a new crafting recipe for turning Budding Cave Moss into Mildewy Amalgam.

Added new Shimmering Substance drops to Claymen and Graven School enemies.

Slightly improved the cast speed and effectiveness of Crystal Release. Channeling this spell now grants a short buff that increases damage negation.

Version 0.10.0B

Fixed an issue with Night's Cavalry boss markers not appearing after being encountered.

Fixed an issue with text appearing incorrectly on newly discovered evergaol map markers.

Fixed a missing hitbox on the Taker's Flame weapon skill.

Fixed some enemy aggro issues in Redmane Castle.

Fixed some minor text issues.

Increased the cast speed of some spells:
- Thop's Barrier
- Zamor Ice Storm/Ancient Tracer
- Glintblade Phalanx/Moonchill/Eternal Darkness
- Terra Magic/Starlight/Lucidity
- Flame, Protect Me/Flame, Grant Me Strength/Flame, Cleanse Me/Black Flame's Protection/Bestial Vitality/Bestial Constitution
- Order's Blade
- Order Healing
- Electrify Armament/Vyke's Dragonbolt/Frozen Dragonbolt
- Dragonbolt Blessing
- Pest Threads/Scarlet Papillon
- Howl of Shabriri

Rememberance items can now be exchanged for x2 Starlight Tokens instead of gear if desired. This can only be done once per Rememberance, even if the Rememberance is duplicated. Also decreased the cost of armors from four Starlight Tokens per piece to three.

Version 0.10.0

Added Latent Spiritsprings and Spiritspring Stormhawks. In some areas of the Lands Between, idle winds now gather in circles, indicating a latent spiritspring that may be awakened. Somewhere in the area - either high above or far below the latent spiritspring - a Spiritspring Stormhawk lies hidden in winds of its own, appearing when approached by the Tarnished. Defeating the Spiritspring Stormhawk unleashes the winds, awakening the spiritspring as a new path or shortcut.

Some old Spiritsprings are now guarded by Spiritspring Stormhawks as well as many new ones.

Added new markers to the world map, with graphics created by atomicjest:
- Bosses are now marked on the map. The marker appears when first engaging the boss.
- Enemy camps are now marked on the map. The marker appears when first engaging a camp guardian.
- "Completion markers" are now added to defeated bosses, cleared enemy camps, and cleared minor dungeons such as Catacombs and Caves.

Hovering over boss and minor dungeon markers now displays information on the state of the boss (Encountered, Defeated, Resurrected).

Site of Grace icons on the map have been decreased in size by about 30% to improve visual clarity. This size change is purely visual and does not affect the ability to select the markers with the cursor.

Some Site of Grace icons in the overworld map now display in a darker hue to indicate being underground, to differentiate them from nearby above-ground Sites of Grace.

Many vanilla map location markers have had their positioning improved, to be either less obscured by sites of grace or less off-center.

Hand-placed player map markers are now blue instead of green, to differentiate them from the new completion markers.

Replaced the map marker for Leyndell, Ashen Capital with an unused icon variant from the game files.

Updated the scaling curve for weapon catalysts to better account for their multi-stat scaling. This will improve their performance at lower levels.

Improved the effectiveness of the Quality affinity passive effect and added an icon and short description for the effect under weapons "Passive Effects."

Updated nearly all weapon skills with a balance pass that slightly increases their FP costs (~15%) and greatly increases their animation speeds. This change is intended to make using skills easier and simpler compared to simply using charged R2 attacks, while keeping their cost balanced relative to their effectiveness.

Added a new background mechanic to spellcasting that will passively reward using a larger variety of spells. Every spell, when cast, will provide a long lasting (40 seconds) but small spell damage boost (1-2% depending on the spell) that stacks with the damage boost of every other spell. A player who uses 10 spells could see up to a 20% damage increase from simply using all of their spells, but even just using 5 spells can give a damage boost of around 10%. This mechanic is not meant to be micromanaged or hyper-optimized, so it isn't visible, it just exists to passively improve the effectiveness of using more varied spell loadouts.

Increased the casting speed of the Ancient Dragon Lightning Spear/Glaive/Strike spells.

Added the following passive effects to armor sets:
- Aristocrat Set: Increases item discovery.
- Black Knife Set: Increases attack power while invisible.
- Blaidd's Set: Reduces the damage taken from frostbite.
- Depraved Perfumer Set: Strengthens perfume items.
- Traveling Perfumer Set: Decreases the FP cost of perfume items.
- Perfumer Set: Increases damage negation after using perfume items.
- Elden Lord's Set: Increases the effectiveness of war cries.
- Fia's Set: Strengthens death sorceries.
- Fire Prelate Set: Increases damage negation after casting Giants' Flame incantations.
- Goldmask's Set: Strengthens Golden Order incantations.
- Juvenile Scholar Set: Regenerates FP while under the effects of sleep.
- Page's Set: Increases projectile damage while wielding crossbows.
- Sage's Set: Strengthens Servant of Rot incantations.

Added the following passive effects to shields:
- Beastman's Jar Shield: Strengthens throwing chakrams.
- Silver Mirrorshield: Decreases the FP cost of sorceries when paired with Loretta's War Sickle.

The Cerulean Hidden Tear now affects items again, as Spirit Ashes are no longer just one time use items.

The Crucible Horn shield now actually deals pierce damage when performing shield bashes like mentioned in the description.

Updated multiple enemies so that they will not enter the combat state when aggroing onto the player. This stops these enemies from closing the map when aggroed alone, at the cost of not triggering in-combat effects. These enemies include baby crabs, small land octopuses, most basic wandering nobles and commoners, most basic slugs, melee and hanging elder albinaurics, basic putrid corpses, ice lightning wisps, dragonflies, and aggressive goats/boars.

Fixed an issue where hostile NPC enemies were not receiving difficulty stat modifiers. Also adjusted the stats and loadouts of most hostile NPCs to have more unique gear like themed talismans and weapon affinities.

Decreased the startup speed of some animations on the Baleful Shadow enemy that were too fast.

Improved the hitboxes of the Wandering Noble, Commoner, and Battlemage enemies.

Added duo AI to the Tree Sentinel duo boss fight. This boss fight now drops the Sentry's Torch as well as the Erdtree Shield.

Added a site of grace to Gowry's Shack. Removed the Primeval Sorcerer Azur and Inner Aeonia sites of graces.

Fast traveling in minor dungeons is now based on the boss being looted instead of defeated, making it so that minor dungeons can now be fast traveled out of even if the boss has been resurrected.

Increased the draw distance of Rune Pieces.

Remembrance weapons can now be purchased twice. Spells and items can still only be purchased once.

The Serpent-Hunter can now be picked up again in every NG+ cycle.

Fixed the Storm Blade projectile dealing Standard damage instead of Strike damage. Fixed issues with the Storm Assault, Stormcaller, and Thunderstorm skills where the damage of the melee hitbox would cancel the damage of the storm AoE, making the Banished Knight set passive useless on them.

Fixed an issue where the Paladin fortune would not restore the correct amount of FP when blocking damage.

Fixed the portal in Raya Lucaria incorrectly leading to a room in Raya Lucaria itself instead of leading to the Church of Vows.

Fixed an issue that would cause the reset prompt to fail when time ran out after certain Archery Challenges due to being too far away from the reset point.

Fixed an issue that would cause Wormfaces and Demi-Human Queens to t-pose and become unkillable when hit with a powerful enough fire damage attack while stance-broken.

Fixed an issue that would cause left-handed Weapon Catalysts to be unable to cast when two-handed without Left-Hand Block enabled.

Updated localization files. UI icons are now available in other languages, however the localization is a work in progress and missing many new strings (which will be shown in English for now).

Version 0.9.5E

Added the 2H R1 combo from the Holy Moonlight Sword to the Dark Moon Greatsword, Golden Order Greatsword, Alabaster Lord's Sword, and Helphen's Steeple. 

The Darkmoon Greatsword combines these new R1s with its already unique R2 attacks. The Helphen's Steeple combines these new R1s with the Claymore's thrusting R2 attacks.

Added a new layer to the fortune system, Minor Fortunes. After defeating the phantom of Godfrey, players will receive the Phantasmal Effigy, an item which allows one to equip a Minor version of a Fortune at Sites of Grace. Minor Fortunes will provide a singular, weaker buff from a fortune, and can be equipped alongside your primary Fortune. The Phantasmal Effigy item will be automatically deposited into your inventory if the phantom Godfrey boss has been defeated on your save.

The selected Minor Fortune can not match the primary fortune. For example, if you equip the Fortune of the Godslayers, you can equip any Fortune you have alongside it as a Minor Fortune except the Fortune of the Godslayers.

Added tutorial messages and items for Fortunes and Minor Fortunes.

Removed Smithing Stone Miner's Bell Bearings from the game entirely. The ability to purchase smithing stones will now automatically unlock when equipping a weapon of the appropriate upgrade level. A +6 weapon will allow access to [1] stones, a +9 weapon will allow acces to [2] stones, a +12 weapon will allow acces to [3] stones, and so on. This also applies to Somber Smithing Stones.

Some of the Smithing Stone Bell Bearings were replaced with a new type of Bell Bearing:

- Poisoned Miner's Bell Bearing: Allows the purchase of Poisoned Stones and Poisoned Stone Clumps. Found in the Seethewater Cave.

Added three new spirit ashes, replacing the drops of some of the Smithing Stone Bell Bearings:
- Ancient Hero Lyedna: An Ancient Hero of Zamor that can be found in the cellar of the Zamor Ruins. Has phase 1 AI when in the passive state, and phase 2 AI when enraged.
- Glintstone Miner Ashes: Two glintstone miners, can be found in the Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel. One who acts aggressive with Rock Blaster, and another who stays back and launches glintstone scraps. When enraged, the caster one will buff its summoner with Starlight, restoring their FP and allowing them to see clearly in dark tunnels.
- Starcaller Ashes: Two starcallers who can be found in the Sellia Crystal Tunnel. One prefers throwing gravity stones, and the other prefers melee attacks.

Updated spirit ashes:
- Increased the strength of the heal when enraging spirit ashes.
- Passive spirit ashes no longer inflict stagger.

Some spirit ash specific changes:
- Marionettes and Avionettes: Can now do their "breakdown" animations when enraged and attacked.
- Kaiden Warrior: Will react to being enraged with a warcry. Can no longer be staggered out of the warcry buff animation, and gains extra damage resistance during warcry.
- Black Knife Tiche and Blackflame Monk Amon: Will use their DoT inflicting abilities rarely when passive, and often when enraged.

Flails can now be powerstanced with axes and hammers.

Some small spell adjustments:
- Reduced the effectiveness of Shattering Crystal at close range, but increased its effectiveness at longer ranges.
- Increased the animation speed of the Briars of Sin/Penance cast animation.

Added colored/elemental weapon trails to multiple enemies to match the trails given to player weapons.

Defeated a target marked by a Sign of the All-Knowing now plays an additional particle effect and sound.

Updated the Black Knife Catacombs Cemetery Shade boss fight to be less annoying with the skeletons. Skeletons now rise on a staggered timer, so if you can kill a single skeleton quickly, you'll never have to deal with more than one at a time.

Updated enemy loot tables with the following item drops for more sources of crafting materials from enemies:
- Cleanrot Knight (Swamp of Aeonia): Now drops Aeonian Butterflies.
- Banished Knight (Castle Sol): Now drops Rimed Crystal Buds.

Fixed multiple issues with weapon trails:
- Fixed the somber fist weapons (Cipher Pata/Veteran's Prosthesis/Clinging Bone) not having their unique trails on their 2H attacks. 
- Fixed the Serpentbone Blade and Cleanrot Spear/Short Spear not having affinity trails on their unique R2 attacks.
- Fixed elemental trails not being used on certain skills. Skills will now use a trail based either on the weapons affinity or the skill itself.

Fixed an issue that made Alexander and Blaidd very overpowered in the Radahn fight.

Version 0.9.4

Updated the Site of Grace menu so that changing difficulties and changing settings are both under one new button called "Reforged options". Also removed the "Pass time" button from the menu while in the Roundtable Hold, as time can't pass in the Roundtable Hold anyway. With these changes no more menu options will be cut off at the bottom of the list due to too many available options.

Added a new submenu for "Compatibility" settings. This menu contains the Seamless Co-op compatibility settings for options like Shared Death, and now also contains a new option to disable enemy scaling for Randomizer compatibility.

Greatly increased the animation speed, hitbox size, and consistency of the Shatter Earth and Rock Blaster Stonedigger sorceries.

Increased the maximum attribute scaling of all damaging consumable items by 33%. The scaling at lower levels of an attribute was nerfed to compensate, but overall it is still a buff of about 5% at low levels of a stat, increasing to the full buff of 33% as you approach 99 of an attribute. This buff is to help keep consumables powerful even in high scaling difficulty endgames.

Improved warming stones. They now heal a small amount of % HP per tick, making them more useful when healing Spirit Ashes. Enemies within range of the warming stone receive a smaller amount of this % HP effect than you and allies do. Also increased the radius of the warming stone effect.

The Raptor Talons now have Raptor of the Mists as their default skill.

Adjusted the prices of all purchaseable arrows and bolts to be slightly lower. Regular bolts will also no longer cost double the price of regular arrows for no reason.

Fixed the chakram throwables using the incorrect animation when riding Torrent.

Shortened some weapon passive effect text that didn't fit on the screen when combined with the new menu icons.

Version 0.9.3A

Fixed some minor issues with weapon trails when weapons were buffed with the cragblade skill.

Fixed an accidental reversion of the visual effects file that made chakrams invisible in the hand before being thrown.

Fixed the Onyx Lord resurrection in the Sealed Tunnel not disabling the Sites of Grace after the boss, the West Altus Divine Tower sites of grace will now be properly disabled.

Fixed an issue where the item pickup animation on Torrent took too long to be cancellable.

Fixed an issue that would cause the new Crystal Tears to respawn in NG+. Also fixed an issue that would cause the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [3] to not respawn in NG+.

Moved the stopping point of the elevator that the Godskin Noble boss takes place on to a lower point, making the arena much brighter and more visible.

Minor text fixes for some text options missing the new menu icons.

Version 0.9.3

Implemented a more permanent fix for any scaling issues involving Seamless Co-op or the Randomzier, enemies can now only obtain one scaling effect at a time, automatically overriding all other scaling effects.

Increased the animation speed of the Spirit Ash use animation. Using Spirit Fury now provides a slight heal to spirit ashes and a short, large increase to their target priority. Also made some minor adjustments to the costs and values of some spirit ashes.

Expanded the attribute scaling letters with S+ and F letters for particularly high or low scaling values. Also fixed an issue where some items like pots would display slightly lower scaling than they actually had.

Decreased the damage of the Death Rite Bird's lingering flames that appear after its Explosive Ghostflame attack to a more reasonable value for a lingering fire pool.

Fixed an issue with the icon file where "Lorem ipsum" would appear over some Binding Rune icons.

Version 0.9.2

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Refined Difficulty description popups. Additional information is now provided on the exact effects of difficulties, with a new look powered by the new UI icons.

Refined Tutorial popups. A new image now indicates they are added by ERR, and an item is added to your inventory as with vanilla tutorials, for re-reading at any point in time.

Added a new tutorial pop-up when summoning a Spirit Ash that explains the new Spirit Fury mechanic.

Adjusted the reinforcement scaling of weapon catalysts to be a bit stronger melee-wise at low levels of reinforcement.

Increased the animation speed of the powerstanced daggers first R1 attack and running attack.

Increased the damage negation of some spirit ashes that took abnormally high amounts of damage, like the demi-humans, lone wolves, and giant rats. These spirit ashes will now have the same damage negation values as the regular enemies, so the stats are viewable in the Codex.

Reduced the saturation and brightness on some of the attribute icons.

Revised health regeneration on harder difficulties. Particularly long and uninterruptible enemy animations have already prevented health from regenerating for their duration in previous versions. Now, these animations will also halt the regeneration timer, allowing more time to interrupt the regeneration upon their conclusion.

Fixed a broken hitbox on the Ordovis' Vortex skill.

Fixed custom trails not working on the Serpentbone Blade unique R2 attacks.

Fixed duplicate blood loss buildup text on a Blood affinity Puppet Scimitar.

Fixed an issue with reinforcing the Vulgar Militia Chain Sickle.

Fixed an issue that would cause the Inescapable Frenzy spell and Lifesteal Fist skill to fail to grab enemies on hard difficulties.

Fixed an issue where the Ice Lightning Wisp icon would appear especially dark.

Version 0.9.1

Altered greatsword movesets in the following ways for more sensible attack animations on these weapons:
- Bastard Sword: Now has the 1H R2 sweeping attacks of the Flamberge.
- Lordworn's Greatsword: No longer uses the Knight's Greatsword R1 animations. Now comes equipped with the Charge Forth skill by default.
- Knight's Greatsword: Now has the Claymore thrust as its first R2 attack, giving it a unique combination of R1 and R2 attacks.
- Flamberge: Now uses the Knight's Greatsword fancier R1 animations.

Increased the strength of the early levels of Spirit Ash reinforcement, removing the power spike that later levels of reinforcement gained, making reinforcement a more steady upgrade process. 

Replaced some high level gloveworts that were too high level for the area they were located in with lower level gloveworts. This will curb some possible super early high level spirit ashes, but this is countered by the increase in effectiveness to lower levels of reinforcement.

Fixed the Nox Flowing Fist being listed as compatible with Ashes of War and having glitchy affinities.

Fixed some issues with certain skills causing a recoil animation when colliding with enemies while the weapon performing the skill was buffed. Fixed for the Storm Kick, Loretta's Slash, Storm Assault, and Frenzyflame Thrust skills.

Fixed an issue that caused charged spells to act strangely when cast with a right/both handed catalyst while low on FP.

Fixed an issue that could cause some enemy grab attacks to fail to trigger in certain situations.

Fixed yet another Codex registration issue with Rennala's summons.

Potentially improved the consistency of crafting recipes when using Seamless Co-op.

Version 0.9.0

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Updated to calibrations version 1.10.0.

Added language support for Simplified Chinese (translated by pellorao). Please note that newly added languages will not contain translations for content added in the same update.

Introduced Weapon Catalysts. Weapon catalysts are weapons which trade their block function for spell-casting. In any situation a regular weapon would block, a weapon catalyst will instead cast a spell, like a catalyst. This makes them particularly useful for two-handing and powerstancing, which previously made it impossible to cast spells. Their stats have been adjusted to provide sane values for both attack power and spell scaling. Use the "Left Hand Block" function at the Site of Grace to tune casting behavior to your liking.

Converted the following weapons to weapon catalysts:
- Carian Knight's Sword: Capable of casting sorceries. Scales spells and melee attacks with dexterity and intelligence. Boosts carian sorceries.

- Lazuli Glintstone Sword: Capable of casting sorceries. Scales spells and melee attacks with a mix of strength, dexterity, and mostly intelligence.

- Troll Knight's Sword: Capable of casting sorceries. Scales spells and melee attacks with strength and intelligence. Boosts carian sorceries.

- Loretta's War Sickle: Capable of casting sorceries. Scales spells and melee attacks with strength, dexterity, and intelligence. Boosts Loretta's greatbow sorceries.

- Varré's Bouquet: Capable of casting incantations. Scales spells and melee attacks with a mix of dexterity, faith, and mostly arcane. Boosts bloodflame incantations.

Added the following new weapons as weapon catalysts:
- Starcaller Spire: The halberd wielded by Starcallers. Capable of casting sorceries. Comes with unique gravitational R2 attacks along with a mix of scythe and halberd moves. Equipped with the Cragblade skill. Scales spells and melee attacks with strength and intelligence, and boosts gravity sorceries. Obtained by defeating the Fallingstar Beast in the Altus Plateau.

- Disciple's Rotten Branch: The spear wielded by Disciples of Rot. Capable of casting incantations. Deals scarlet rot buildup on melee hits. Equipped with the Poison Moth Flight skill. Scales spells and melee attacks with dexterity and faith, and boosts servant of rot incantations. Found in the Tombsward Cave.

Added the following new standard weapons:
- Iron Spike: The dagger wielded by winged Misbegotten. Scales primarily with strength. Can be obtained from a new camp chest in Leyndell along with the Iron Greatsword, located near the existing group of Misbegotten.

- Sun Realm Sword: The straight sword wielded by Skeleton Knights. Scales primarily with strength, and has blocking R2 attacks from the Carian Knight Sword. Can be obtained from a new camp chest in the Mountaintops of the Giants along with the Grave Scythe, located near a group of wandering skeletons.

- Marionette Short Sword: The small sword wielded by Marionette Soldiers. Inflicts blood loss. Can be obtained from a camp chest outside the Sellia gate, along with the next new weapon.

- Avionette Scimitar: Scimitars wielded by Avionette Soldiers. Inflicts blood loss and is held as a dual weapon when two handed. Can be obtained from a camp chest outside the Sellia gate, along with the previously mentioned Marionette Short Sword.

- Pumpkin Head Sledgehammer: Large hammer wielded by Mad Pumpkin Heads. Comes equipped with the Spinning Strikes skill by default. Can be obtained from a new camp at the Academy Gatetown, along with the Chainlink Flail.

- Lordsworn's Spear: The spear wielded by Lordsworn Soldiers. Can be found inside the usually empty room at the entrance to Castle Morne.

- Avionette Pig Sticker: Long halberd wielded by Avionette Soldiers. Inflicts blood loss and has the unique R1s of the Guardian Swordspear. Can be obtained alongside the Marionette Soldier Birdhelm from a new camp chest on the rooftops of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.

- Crude Iron Claws: Short claws now wielded by Mad Pumpkin Heads. Inflicts blood loss. Can be obtained alongside the Pumpkin Helm from a new camp chest in the ruined battlegrounds of the Capital Outskirts.

Added the following new somber weapons:
- Red Wolf's Fang: The summoned sword wielded by the Red Wolves. Deals pure magic damage and only scales with intelligence, similar to the Coded Sword. Has the Beastman Curved Swords spinning jumping attacks and comes with a unique skill, the "Red Wolf's Gambol". Obtained by defeating the Red Wolf of the Champion.

- Makar's Ceremonial Cleaver: A variant of the Magma Wyrm Scalesword that scales more with dexterity than strength, with a unique model made by WitWoe. Obtained by defeating Magma Wyrm Makar. The original Scalesword has been changed to drop from the Magma Wyrm in the Volcano Manor.

- Vulgar Militia Chain Sickle: A unique paired weapon based on the "kusarigama" wielded by the Vulgar Militia. When held in the right hand, functions as an axe by using the sickle. When held in the left hand, functions as a whip by using the chain. Two-handing the weapon uses the sickle as light attack, and the off-handed whip as heavy attack. Its unique skill, "Trapper's Step", is a Quickstep variant which deploys either a smoke bomb or a poison trap depending on the hand the weapon is carried in. Found in the Forbidden Lands.

- Nox Flowing Fist: The fist form of the Nox Flowing Hammer rarely wielded by Nox Monks. Drains enemy stamina on hit like the other Nox weapons and has high blocking stats for a fist. Obtained by defeating a miniboss added to a small new room in Nokstella.

Changed the following weapon movesets:
- Ordovis's Greatsword: Changed R2 attacks to that of the Death's Poker and Sword of Milos.

- Lordsworn's Greatsword: Now has a unique combination of the Knight's Greatsword R1 attacks and the Claymore thrust R2.

- Torchpole: Changed the R2 attacks to the Partisan sweeping attacks.

- Large Club/Omenkiller Cleaver: Added restored animations for the first R2 from DS3, a wild leaping R2 attack. The Pumpkin Head Sledgehammer also uses this attack.

Diversified weapon stamina consumption and poise damage multipliers to be a bit more unique for each weapon. These are small changes to the stamina consumption and poise damage values that aren't super noticeable in game, but it should make each weapon feel slightly more unique. These stats are hidden just like in vanilla, so they can't be shown in game.

Standardized the effectiveness of the Wakizashi powerstance with katanas. It will now be more effective at powerstancing with katanas. The Wakizashi can also be wielded in the right hand with left-hand katanas.

Added a small detail to show stat scaling for arcane weapons in game. If a weapon scales arcane with damage, it will now show at minimum an arcane requirement of 1. A requirement of 0 means that the arcane scaling is only for status effects. It's not a perfect solution to the UI issue, but it is a neat trick to know. This also applies to intelligence and faith scaling, any weapon or affinity that scales damage with those stats will have a minimum requirement of 1.

Introduced unique attack trails for most weapons. A weapon's affinity, property such as status buildup, or connection to a certain subject or material will now be represented by a distinct trail when swinging the weapon. A number of completely new and unique trails have been introduced to accommodate this.

Added two new throwable items with two variants of each:
 - Azula Chakram
 - Azula Lightning Chakram
 - Crystalian Chakram
 - Putrid Crystalian Chakram

These items can be crafted from the new cookbooks:
 - Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook [5], sold by the Dragonbarrow Isolated Merchant.
 - Glintstone Craftsman's Cookbook [9], sold by Iji the Blacksmith.
 
Updated cookbooks so that they can now be deposited into the chest at Sites of Grace. When deposited, cookbook recipes will no longer appear in the menu, allowing players to customize their crafting menu as they see fit. This change will also improve recipe syncing with Seamless Co-op.

Greatly increased the poise damage of throwing pot items. Pot poise damage now increases with the base damage of the pot.

Added a new spell, a Crystalian sorcery named Crystal Volley. It is themed after Rennala's attack which fires off multiple small crystal shards in quick succession. It can be obtained from a glintstone Albinauric crab located near the Crystalians by the Albinauric Village.

Fixed the Briars of Guilt spell using the incorrect casting animation. Improved the projectile consistency of the Briars of Penance.

Multiplied the displayed stamina values x10 to match the higher values of HP AND FP. Also added a % based stamina regeneration effect, making higher maximum stamina more valuable as a way to increase passive stamina regeneration.

Added a small increase to movement speed at light equip load, and a small decrease to movement speed at heavy equip load.

Introduced the Spirit Fury system. Spirit Ashes are now, by default, companions with reduced damage output who will be largely ignored by enemies and bosses. Using the Spirit Ash additional times after summoning will incite rage in the summoned spirit, increasing their damage dealt and taken, as well as their target priority for a limited time. This process can be repeated when the spirit has calmed. Inciting the spirit's wrath incurs an additional FP cost.

Summoning spirit ashes and inciting their wrath can now be performed faster and while moving.

Improved the user interface and experience by adding new icons and visuals to the menus and dialogue options in the game. Attributes, effects and values in the menus will now be accompanied by a fitting icon to aid orientation at a glance. Similar icons have been added to all NPC dialogue in the game, with full coverage for all Site of Grace options as well as major dialogue options on many NPCs, and a generic icon for the rest. Many thanks to Torbi for contributing almost all of these icons.

Restored a cut attack to the spear-wielding Crystalians that has them extend their spear with summoned crystals. This attack will give them more variety in their moveset other than their constant pokes.

Added the unused claw model to the Chainlink Flail Mad Pumpkin Head enemy variant. This is where the Crude Iron Claw weapon comes from.

Replaced the Fire Prelate in the Nox Nightmaiden boss fight with a simpler Mad Pumpkin Head enemy wielding a flaming hammer. This Mad Pumpkin Head also wears a special Silver Pumpkin Helm which can be obtained after defeating the boss.

Added the headdress of Miriel, Pastor of Vows: the Chelonian Mitre. It can be obtained by giving Miriel all of the available scrolls and prayerbooks. Alternately, he will drop it upon death.

Added the following additional armor alterations:
- Blue Silver Mail Skirt: Adds shoes.
- Sanguine Waistcloth: Adds shoes.
- Iron Helmet: Pulls the face mask over the character's nose and changes the helmet shape.

Picking up crafting materials in the world will now cause a short, non-intrusive pickup animation to play.

Made some minor changes to some descriptions to address inconsistencies and mistranslations from the Japanese text.

Fixed an issue where performing a jump attack immediately after jump dismounting off of Torrent would cause the weapon hitbox to fail to activate.

Fixed an issue that caused the Binding Rune of Cradled Starlight to regenerate less FP than intended.

Fixed the Fated affinity only being equippable on physical Ashes of War. All Ashes of War can now access this affinity.

Fixed an issue with resetting entities located in or around the Stranded Graveyard in the Eternal Return game mode.

Fixed an issue that could cause unintentionally high enemy scaling when the enemy scaling system and the randomizer combined.

Fixed an issue where item drop rates in the Codex would be rounded excessively.

Version 0.8.1

Increased the poise damage of arrows/bolts and added 25% guard pierce to bolts.
- Arrows: 2 poise damage -> 2.5/3 poise damage depending on the arrow
- Greatarrows: Greatarrows already had a fitting poise damage value of 8/12 depending on the arrows.
- Bolts: 2 poise damage -> 4/4.5 poise damage depending on the bolt
- Greatbolts: 8 poise damage -> 10/12/14 poise damage depending on the bolt

Increased the animation speed of crossbow firing on horseback.

Fixed a vanilla issue where greatbolts made very little sound on impact. They now make the same sound as greatarrows.

Added more % based FP regeneration to generator spells on hit, making them able to regenerate larger FP bars more quickly.

Slightly increased the animation speed of the following spell cast animations:
- Rock Blaster/Shatter Earth
- Glintblade/Carian/Greatblade Phalanx
- Carian Greatsword/Adula's Moonblade/Carian Piercer
- Rock Sling/Stone Sling
- Gravity Well/Collapsing Stars
- Magma Shot/Roiling Magma
- Rykard's Rancor/Creeping Rancor
- Briars of Punishment
- Burn, O Flame!
- Black Flame Ritual
- Bloodboon
- Order Healing
- Beast Claw
- Pest Threads/Scarlet Papillon
- The Flame of Frenzy

Perfumes now craft one at a time instead of three at a time. The crafting cost has been reduced to compensate, though they are still slightly more expensive.

Added a new enemy detection system that will make enemies who are attacked alert any nearby enemies to your presence. This will only affect enemies who are standing in close proximity to eachother, and will not trigger from critical attacks like backstabs or attacks that oneshot the enemy.

Added an additional lock-on point for Tree Sentinel-type enemies to make it easier to hit them with ranged attacks.

Updated the Troll enemy's sword drawing animation with additional negation, and removed the poise reset triggered by said animation.

Added hard mode AI to Malenia along with some unused attack animations and drowsy AI.

Fixed an issue where camp enemies could fail to aggro to the player.

Added some extra checks to prevent a softlock if the Codex book item fails to work.

Version 0.8

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Added a new system for character customization: Body Hues. Body Hues allow you to dye your character in a color of choice to further personalize your looks. They can be accessed from the Clouded Mirror Stand in Roundtable Hold if you own at least one Palette item.

There are 6 unique Palettes containing 3 colors each, which are available in the variants "Normal", "Subtle", "Intense" and "Metallic". This makes for a total of 72 body hues available to the player.

Thanks to HALCYON of Elden Ring Reborn for figuring out the technical method of applying a tint to the player character.

Added a new overworld activity: Rainbow Scarab Archery Challenges. By interacting with new fallen imp statues around the world, you can put your bow mastery to the test in a timed challenge. Fallen imp statues are highlighted by a wreath of blue flames.

Upon starting the challenge, a timer will begin which is tracked by a status icon under your health bar. Shoot all rainbow scarabs in the prepared challenge course to succeed. You can reset and retry the challenge at the fallen imp statue any time. The "reset" prompt also briefly becomes available in the final few seconds of the timer. Interact with it to be transported back to the fallen imp statue.

Archery Challenges may be found in:
- Weeping Peninsula
- Liurnia of the Lakes
- Caelid
- Altus Plateau
- Consecrated Snowfield
- Ashen Leyndell

Completing an Archery Challenge will reward you with a unique, themed Palette containing 3 colors in 4 variants each, for a total of 12 body hues per Palette. Visit the Isolated Merchant on the shores of the Weeping Peninsula for a note containing the location of the first challenge.

Added a new enemy: the Haligtree Knight's Steed. It is clad in drapery befitting a Haligtree Knight. The Codex was updated with a new entry for this creature.

Added two new craftable consumables: Stormhoof Raisins and Erdbark Raisins. Stormhoof Raisins greatly increase Torrent's speed at the cost of increased vulnerability. Erdbark Raisins greatly increase Torrent's damage negation at the cost of reverting to vanilla movement speed. The crafting recipes can be learned by acquiring the Stable Master's Cookbook [1] from a mounted Haligtree Knight patrolling the Mistwood road.

Added status icons to notify the player when Torrent is afflicted by status effects.

Updated the cost of all items purchasable with Starlight Tokens, and increased the amount of Starlight Tokens gained from 1 to 10. This allows items like armor and cookbooks to cost a fewer amount of tokens compared to more valuable items like weapons and talismans. Old starlight tokens can be converted into 10 new tokens by using them in the menu.

Added a Spirit Ash shop to the Starlight Token menu and added a new set of items to a miscallenous shop tab including rare/legendary Fortunes and the new Palettes.

Added a site of grace to the upper level of the Chapel of Anticipation for easier returns to the Altar.

Replaced the precision aim mode on short bows with the block function, complete with Deflects. This was done due to vanilla bugs with the precision aiming mode which cannot be easily addressed. Fortunately, giving short bows access to blocking fortifies their identity as a (comparatively) close range option.

Adjusted regeneration effects such as the Blessed and Magic affinities, Blessed Dew Talisman, and the Moon of Nokstella. They are now more effective, while only applying during combat. This gives them a stronger presence in combat while avoiding balance issues between encounters.

Adjusted the visual effects of a successful Deflect to be slightly less pronounced and fixed some minor errors with the Deflect system.

Added a small incantation damage increase to the Paladin fortune to give a boost to its faith aspects and slightly decreased the stamina regeneration penalty.

Increased the poise damage and stagger power of Weighty Stones and Sanctified Stones.

Rebalanced the materials required for some crafting recipes. Added Fulgurbloom and Gravel Stone drops to some Banished Knights for some extra sources of Crackling Substance.

Fixed an issue that would cause effects that rely on in combat checks to not work.

Fixed an error that caused screenspace reflections to fail to render.

Fixed the missing Beast classification on Azash, Pride of the Redmanes and other enemies.

Fixed broken Codex interactions outside of the War-Dead Catacombs.

Fixed some issues with the positions and scale of various Reforged icons.

Pruned the mod's map folder by removing all unused, empty maps, reducing archive size a little.

Updated localization files.

Version 0.7.7B

Fixed an issue that caused the Codex item to fail when in an overworld tile that was affected by a map change like the Nokron meteor or the burning of the Erdtree.

Fixed the Codex item being unusable in no combat zones.

Added a short cooldown to the Codex item on spawn to prevent an issue where using the item before the Codex entity had loaded would result in a softlock.

Fixed an issue where Raytracing would not correctly function in some areas due to lighting changes.

Moved the Death Rite Bird boss on the Mountaintops of the Giants to the correct boss resurrection sub menu.

Version 0.7.7A

Updated the Codex of the All-Knowing to act as a usable item, allowing the Codex to be viewed anywhere in the game by using the book itself. 

The Codex can now be used to see enemy stats and weaknesses anywhere, though getting hit will close the menu as the player can't act while reading the Codex. The game world will pause when viewing an entry as it always does when a tutorial popup appears.

The option to view the Codex at the site of grace has been removed to reduce clutter on the site of grace menu.

This was quite a big technical challenge to implement the Codex in this way, but it should work smoothly and is even mostly compatible with multiple players in Seamless Co-op, though only one player can view the menu at a time.

Increased the animation speed and distance of some dual fist weapon attacks.

Fixed an issue with the Manor Towershield's weight when it was given an affinity.

Fixed the affinity text of the bestial affinity so that it fits on the affinity screen.

Version 0.7.7

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Added language support for:

* Italiano / Italian (Translated by Volk, proofreading by kemkera)

Addressed some issues with the French and Portuguese translations.

Updated the localization files.

Applied the Standard damage modifications to the player, making enemies that deal Standard damage deal neutral damage to the player. This can be thought of as an armor piercing effect, as armor no longer gives Standard damage resistance. Buffs and special effects that provide damage negation will still provide Standard damage resistance. 

Adjusted the thousands of enemy hitboxes to remove all cases of enemy Standard damage that didn't fit this new implementation. The types of enemy attacks that deal Standard damage are now:
	- Physical based critical attacks
	- Gas/liquid based attacks
	- Gravitational force attacks
	- Destined Death attacks
	- Certain uniquely powerful enemy attacks 
	- Other miscellaneous attacks that Standard damage fit, like those of the Fire Giant and Spirit Jellyfish
The base damage of these attacks has generally been reduced to account for the armor piercing properties.

Added new icons for the crafting list intermediate material recipes (Alchemics, Extracts) which display the material which is being procesesd in the recipe, making the list a little easier to view.

Added a new recipe for Rimed Extract, craftable from Dewkissed Herba. This provides an early source of Frostbite crafted items.

The "Clear material recipes" setting is now on by default. The crafting list will only populate with intermediate recipes that you currently have the materials for. This can be turned back off at the Site of Grace.

Added a respawning Frost Elder Lion to the northeast cliffs of the Consecrated Snowfield for Codex completion.

Fixed an issue that would cause Codex entries to fail to register when killing enemies with "large" or "dismounted" critical attack animations.

Increased the speed of stationary dismount Torrent animations and fixed a bug where the player couldn't cancel the stationary dismount animation at all when dismounting on Torrent's right side.

Finally fixed the issue that caused the player to be unable to double jump with Torrent when falling off of an edge while wielding most heavier weapons.

Fixed an issue where enemies on normal mode could sometimes be upgraded to adept difficulty, causing them to spontaneously recover HP.

Updated Gideon to v2.2.1.0.

Version 0.7.6D

Fixed Seamless Co-op scaling compatibility for real this time.

Fixed an issue that caused multi-hit attacks to be less effective with status afflicting weapon buffs than intended.

Fixed an ambient occulsion error in the Volcano Manor lighting.

Updated the lighting on the character preview and character creator screens.

The level up button will now have a notification when a level up is possible.

Version 0.7.6C

Fixed an oversight in Seamless Co-op compatibility that could break area scaling despite the previous update. This change also fixes enemy stat desyncs when players have different difficulties selected. For area scaling and difficulty scaling, it will now always use the host's scaling.

Version 0.7.6B

Fixed a bug with Seamless Co-op and the area scaling mechanic that would cause it to scale more than one time if players were on different levels of area scaling. It will now only scale with the host's scaling.

Fixed an oversight that would allow for the Discovered Entry notifications to appear for enemies that were already marked before update 0.7.6.

Fixed skeletons being targetable after death when killed with a Sacred weapon or other Undead damage boosting source.

Fixed an issue with the new starter classes where they all wore the Type 1 face, including the Type 2 bodies.

Fixed some small map issues like missing window frames on certain buildings in Volcano Manor and clipping on some walls.

Fixed an issue where Tarnished Golden Sunflowers would fail to be collected if the player was lucky and rolled a double drop.

Adjusted the health of Rennala's summons to make killing them a bit easier.

Fixed some Puppet Wandering Nobles that were incorrectly not tagged as Puppets.

Removed an out of date note from the Dragonbarrow merchant.

Version 0.7.6

Updated the Codex of the All-Knowing. Engaging enemies now "discovers" them for the Codex, creating a basic Codex entry with vague information about the target's strengths and weaknesses. This overview contains a prompt to properly track and defeat the target with a Sign of the All-Knowing to unlock the full entry. Killing the target is not required for the discovery entry.

Lowered the crafting cost of Signs of the All-Knowing to 1 of each elemental substance and increased the item use animation speed slightly.

Added a codex entry for the Hallowed Avatar.

Added 4 new starting classes inspired by the upcoming Japanese ELDEN RING Tabletop RPG:

* Perfumer: A dextrous chemist of the Royal Capital. Finds empowerment in miracle perfumes and beats back opponents with a whip.
* Scout: A sharpshooter who defected from a demigod's army in the Shattering. Capable with bows and crossbows.
* Gladiator: An underdog of society forced to risk their life for entertainment, using fists as lethal weapons.
* Guide: A hopeful of Erdtree faith eager to guide fellow Tarnished towards grace. Well-versed in healing incantations.

The new classes come with new graphical menu entries, unique starting loadouts and stat allocations.

Some existing classes were adjusted to fit along with these new choices.

Turned the Baleful Shadow encounter in Ainsel River into a boss encounter. It now has a boss healthbar, fogwalls, can be resurrected at the Roundtable Hold, and gets a Destined Death themed Wolf's Assault attack. Also improved the hitboxes of Blaidd/the Baleful Shadow.

Updated the lighting in the Roundtable Hold.

Replaced the invulnerability frames during critical attacks with the less potent roll frames. This allows the player character to be affected by various (positive) effects during critical attacks, such as the Warlock status presence buff.

Updated the Blasphemous Blade with Magma and Occult affinity effects.

Added a second hitbox to Scythe critical attacks, making the hitboxes better match the animation.

Improved the fluidity of the sprint jump motion when transitioning back into a sprint.

Fixed issues with the Brick Hammer and Iron Cleaver Fated affinities.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Grafted Scion to be stronger than intended on the return visit.

Fixed some error messages that could appear when saving and reloading in very out of the way areas.

Fixed a floating rock in Redmane Castle.

Updated the localization files.

Updated Gideon to 2.2.0.0, including various bugfixes. If you've had issues with the "Setup UI Images" shortcut before, try again.

Version 0.7.5

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Restored the UI icons for affinities, visible in the affinity selection and upon weapon icons in various parts of the UI. Added new icons for Reforged affinities, and updated some existing ones for more variety.

Added the final weapon affinity, the Fated affinity. The Fated affinity applies a unique combination of affinity effects to each melee armament. The Fated Whetblade item will unlock the Fated affinity. It can be obtained by summoning and defeating the endgame superboss, the Hallowed Avatar, on the Stone Platform.

Updated the icon for the Whetblade Fragment. Adjusted the texts in the Whetblade Fragment menu at the smithing table.

Applied some UI layouts from Detailed Item Descriptions (thanks Dziggy!) for potential future expansion of some descriptions.

Adjusted the message received when dying and preserving your runes on lower difficulties. Added a prompt to the short description of Fortunes which prompts players to "Examine using <button>".

Removed the "Sealed by Morgott the Grace-Given" gate before the Forbidden Lands, as the Grand Lift of Rold already acts as a progression gate. The hidden room containing the Blade of Calling has been changed slightly to account for this.

Added a crimson tear scarab to the second half of Redmane Castle. Added an object near a Rune Piece in the lowest parts of Stormveil to make it easier to restart the jumping challenge.

Added a level scaling system to early game areas that increases the level of lower level areas as your own level increases. This system won't increase an areas level until you are past its intended level, and it will keep these areas lower leveled than the areas your character is properly leveled for. 

As an example, Limgrave level 1 enemies will gain a boost to level 2 when the player gets a +2 Somber weapon or equivalent regular weapon. At this point the player is already more prepared to fight level 3 or 4 enemies, but this helps keep certain areas competitive as you level up. This system stops when obtaining +10 Somber weapon/+25 weapon, with low level enemies being capping at level 10-12 while the player is fighting the endgame level 14-20 enemies.

This system scales enemy rune drops as well, so any enemy or boss you go back to fight that has had its level increased will reward an appropriate amount of runes. This system is not used in NG+ as NG+ already scales enemies.

Updated lighting in multiple legacy dungeons like Stormveil Castle, Raya Lucaria and Volcano Manor. Also updated the lighting in Rykard's phase 2 cutscene and warp position after the cutscene to match.

Removed the innate magic/holy damage from the Clayman's Harpoon and Treespear as these weapons can get affinities, and the innate damage messed with affinity scaling. The enemies who use these weapons didn't even deal magic or holy damage anyway.

Balanced weapon damage:
	- Decreased the damage of weapons that applied status effects but had more damage than weapons in the same class that did not apply status effects.
	- Increased the damage of weapons that had randomly low damage in their class, like the Great Mace.
	
Merged the Stamp (Sweep) and Stamp (Upward Cut) skills into a single Stamp skill. Old Ashes of War for Stamp can be discarded, and the new Ash of War can be obtained using Lost Ashes of War or from the Ash of War Scarab in Limgrave that dropped the original Stamp (Upward Cut).
	
Added the following passives to weapons:
	- Serpent-God's Curved Sword: Now has passive poison buildup, it is still able to receive affinities.
	- Wing of Astel: Now has the Night passive.
	- Troll's Hammer: Now has the Fell passive and boosts Giants' Flame incantations.
	- Ringed Finger: Now has the Heavy passive.

Updated the following spells:
	- Increased the animation speed and damage consistency of Crystal Release.
	- Increased the damage of the Singularity explosion slightly.
	- Increased the damage and poise damage of Rykard's Rancor slightly.
	- Increased the animation speed of O, Flame!
	- Changed Noble Presence from a 1 slot spell to a 3 slot spell, and its FP cost from 210 to 630. It now deals massive poise damage to enemies in a slightly wider area.

Adjusted the scaling curve of spell catalysts, so that they start out stronger but end at the same strength through reinforcement. This change increases the initial stat scaling of catalysts by 20%, but decreases the amount gained through reinforcement by that same amount. Fixed an issue with some catalysts that would cause them to have lower scaling than intended when having between 1 and 30 of the catalysts damage stat.

Gave boss healthbars to all of the Ulcerated Tree Spirit enemies, as there are no statistical differences between the versions that do have the boss healthbar and the versions that don't.

Increased the cooldown timer on Azash's fire attacks on lower difficulties. Slightly decreased the aggressiveness of Maliketh and the Leonine Misbegotten on lower difficulties.

Decreased the max purchaseable amount of Grafted Runes from 10 per rune to 5. This change makes the total amount of Grafted Runes match the amount of other Binding runes. Players should consume any excess of these type of Binding Runes they have in their inventory to avoid losing Rune Pieces.

Fixed the Wraith Calling Bell not having any damage scaling.

Fixed an error message that could appear if the game was quit and reloaded while inside the Ancestor Spirit boss room.

Fixed Crucible Knight Siluria being able to enter a passive AI state despite being a solo boss.

Fixed the Night's Cavalry Horse and Rennala's Summons enemies not being codexable (again).

Fixed an issue where spirit ashes that dealt certain status or damage over time effects would deal significantly more damage than intended.

Version 0.7.1

Added a roll cancel window to the startup of all spell cast animations. The length of this window depends on the animation.

Increased the cast speed of some spells like Golden Star, Radagon's Rings of Light, and some other small speed increases.

Improved the projectile of the full moon spells.

Added the gravitational affinity, including the decreased weight, to the Meteorite Staff. Added the magma affinity to the Gelmir Glinstone Staff, in case you want to punch frostbitten targets with it for some reason. Added the fell affinity to the Giant's Seal so it can drain status effects faster.

Added a range limit to Greyoll's Roar (the enemy version, not the spell).

Updated the lighting in the Godskin Apostle boss room in the Divine Tower of Caelid during phase 2.

Fixed a ledge in Redmane Castle that could trigger the fall death camera.

Fixed some issues with enemy reactions to projectile attacks.

Version 0.7.0

Note: This update contains new or changed icons. Please re-run the "Update UI Images" shortcut in the ERR folder.

Added language support for:

- Français / French (Translated by wings, Luwae, Agito L'agité, cust, Firefloc, Freenix, Le Gourdiflet, Neanesis, Uncle Psy)
- Português / Portuguese (Translated by niscolas, Michelle Castro, Sobolewski, Alzh)

As always, new texts from this update are in English and will be translated at a later date.

Overhauled the Redmane Castle dungeon, with an updated path that takes players through a more involved route through the dungeon and a new boss replacing the Misbegotten Warrior and Crucible Knight duo. Defeating this new boss, "Azash, Pride of the Redmanes" is now required to activate the Radahn Festival.

The Misbegotten Warrior with the Ruins Greatsword drop can now be fought in a solo fight at the War-Dead Catacombs, which is no longer scaled to the Dragonbarrow area but now shares the area scaling of the Wailing Dunes. The Ulcerated Tree Spirit boss in that catacombs has been removed. 

The Misbegotten Warrior and the new boss in Redmane Castle will both automatically be revived and have their loot reset upon updating to make it acquirable even if the boss that was previously occupying the arena has already been defeated. Any currently active Sites of Grace within Redmane Castle will be reset as well.

Added a new area entrance and area mechanic to the Academy of Raya Lucaria. The hidden entrance can be accessed through the Academy Crystal Cave, and also unlocks a special mechanic that can be used to boost magic damage when fighting the highly magic resistant bosses of the Academy. Due to the increased importance of the Academy Crystal Cave, the boss has been upgraded from a Crystalian Duo to a Crystalian Trio. Regular Crystalians are much weaker than the Putrid Crystalians, so it isn't as hard of a fight as the existing trio, but it's still relatively challenging compared to what it was before. To help players who may need it, Old Knight Istvan now appears as a summon right before the boss.

The Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel boss has been upgraded to a Crystalian Duo from the single Crystalian it was before.

Replaced the R1 attack of the Unsheathe and Transient Moonlight skills with a katana parry animation instead from the original katana weapon skill. Thanks to Cleverraptor6 for bringing the animation to Elden Ring.

Added a new weapon, dropped by the new boss of Redmane Castle. The "Fury of Azash" is a curved greatsword with the fire affinity and a unique upgraded version of Lion's Claw, the Lion's Flame.

Added a new unique skill, Dragonbolt, to the Dragonclaw Greatshield. Dragonbolt is a skill similar to Thunderbolt, but it can be used in the left or right hand.

Increased the animation speed of the Impaling Thrust and Piercing Fang skills.

Changed the visual effects of the Carian Grandeur weapon skill to better fit its Carian theme.

Added a new effect to the Sacred Relic Sword that increases attack power and defense when at either maximum or low HP.

Added the following passive effects to some weapons:
	- Heavy: Grafted Blade Greatsword
	- Keen: Axe of Godrick
	- Magic: Watchdog's Staff/Carian Knight's Shield
	- Magma: Devourer's Scepter
	- Blessed: Erdtree Greatshield/Erdtree Bow/Erdtree Greatbow/Silver Mirrorshield
	- Drains poison: Coil Shield
	- Drains scarlet rot: Cleanrot Spear
	- Drains frostbite: Ice Crest Shield
	- Boosts carian sorcery: Carian Knight's Sword/Troll Knight's Sword
	- Boosts cold sorcery: Darkmoon Greatsword/Zamor Curved Sword
	- Boosts gravity sorcery: Starscourge Greatswords/Alabaster Lord's Sword/ Onyx Lord's Sword
	- Boosts death sorcery: Death's Poker/Family Heads
	- Boosts fundamentalist incantations: Golden Order Greatsword
	- Boosts erdtree incantations: Golden Halberd/Erdtree Greatshield/Staff of the Avatar/Rotten Staff
	- Boosts blood oath incantations: Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear
	- Boosts godslayer incantations: Godslayer's Greatsword
	- Boosts crucible aspect incantations: Crucible Hornshield
	- Boosts giantsflame incantations: One-Eyed Shield
	- Boosts dragon cult incantations: Dragon King's Cragblade/Bolt of Gransax/Dragon Greatclaw/ Dragonclaw Greatshield
	- Boosts dragon communion incantations: Magma Wyrm Scalesword

Slightly increased the poise damage of nearly all spells by around 1-2 points to help bridge the gap between weapon poise damage and spell poise damage.

Improved the consistency and effectiveness of the Shard Spiral spell.

Slightly increased the effectiveness of Order's Blade and Order Healing to account for the effects of the new split scaling.

Fixed an issue that would cause Adula's Moonblade to hit inconsistently and deal less damage than intended.

Adjusted the icons and descriptions of Oracle's Remedy, Oracle Effigy and Starlight Token to bring them further in line with the setting of ELDEN RING.

Fixed the missing hitbox on the Serpent-Hunter rolling attacks.

Added the new boss and magic guardian golems to the Codex.

Removed the Battlefield Approach Site of Grace as it could cause issues with the game state of the Radahn Festival.

Potentially fixed a bug that could cause NPC quests to not reset properly when going to NG+.

Version 0.6.7C

Added language support for:

- 日本語 / Japanese (translated by Furisuke with help from takasago)

Updated all language files for the new text entries from 0.6.7.

Version 0.6.7B

Fixed the broken text when using the German, Russian, and Korean languages.

Added a summon sign for Millicent in Castle Sol. Millicent must have reached the Mountaintops of the Giants or Elphael Prayer Room to be summoned.

Added some Crystal Darts to Impaler's Catacombs, home of the Watchdog + 4 Imps boss fight.

Order's Blade now requires an intelligence and faith scaling catalyst to receive its full buff. This change gives int+fth users a usable weapon buff.

Order Healing now gives a small heal on cast that scales with both intelligence and faith. This gives int+fth users a decent heal.

The Immutable Shield spell now increases guarding stability and lasts 60 seconds like the Scholar's Shield spell, but has reduced effectiveness for blocking elemental damage and status effects.

Fixed some minor bullet issues with the Ancient Tracer and Frozen Lightning Wisp spells.

Fixed the broken scaling on the Occult Beastman's Cleaver.

Restored missing text strings for Codex ascension.	

Version 0.6.7A

Fixed issues with the Ancient Tracer spell where it could be used on Torrent and in no-combat zones. Also fixed it only costing 1 spell slot instead of 2.

Fixed the Frozen Lightning Wisp not counting as a Dragon Cult spell for damage buffs.

Fixed some scaling mistakes on weapons like the Golem's Halberd, Iron Cleaver, and Battle Hammer.

Added some new attack animation followup improvements to curved sword and curved greatsword light to heavy chains.

Version 0.6.7

ELDEN RING Reforged is now officially available in 3 more languages:

- Deutsch / German (translated by Dark Listener and TruthanTV)
- Русский / Russian (translated by Буханка_Глеба and Isolated Mind with testing by Raiden)
- 한국인 / Korean (translated by From Software Minor Gallery, 도바킨 and HWASAL)

Many thanks to the community translators. These languages are fully playable with all aspects of Reforged translated.

Note: Translations will not be able to keep parity with Reforged updates, and so the newest additions may remain in English, and be translated later down the line.

Added partial support for all other languages. These languages will have missing texts replaced with English ones, but use original strings where possible.

Consider helping to translate the game into your language at the ERR Discord #translation-volunteers channel.

Translation mistakes can also be reported in that channel.

-

Releases of ELDEN RING Reforged now come bundled with README, CHANGELOG and CREDITS files. The CHANGELOG.txt file lists all updates to the mod since version 0.1.8.

Added two new spells:
	- Ancient Tracer: A sorcery obtained from the hidden magical Guardian Golem in the Dragonbarrow, it conjures the magical turrets they use.
	- Frozen Lightning Wisp: An incantation obtained from a newly placed Giant Incantation Scarab in the Consecrated that summons a Lightning Wisp to attack the targeted enemy.
	
Buffed some spells:
	- Zamor Ice Storm: Increased cast speed as Ancient Tracer shares this cast animation.
	- Flame Sling/Other Fireballs: Increased uncharged cast speed.
	- Increased the uncharged poise damage of many spells that had too large of a gap between charged and uncharged poise damage.
	
Weapon scaling changes:
	- Diversified the scaling of many weapons like the Lordsworn's Straight Sword, so that no base weapon is a pure 50%/50% quality scaling weapon or a pure 100% strength and 0% dex weapon. Weapons now cap at a split of 90%/10% scaling or 60%/40% scaling between strength and dexterity. Limiting these extremes allows for better balancing of the heavy, keen, and quality affinities.
	- Fixed many minor weapon scaling inconsistencies that could cause weapons to scale slightly (2-3%) better with the quality affinity and some other affinities than intended.
	- Also increased the scaling of many weapons that had high base damage but low scaling so that they get a similar return from scaling as other weapons, the base damage of these weapons was decreased to compensate.

The Fortune of Latenna and Fortune of the Paladin now only decrease movement speed while in combat.

Added a new area separation to Stormhill, making the area slightly higher scaled than the rest of Limgrave. It is still a lower level than Stormveil Castle, but now bridges the gap between Limgrave and Stormveil better.

Increased the range of the status effect exultation effects slightly to make them more consistent. Also added a model point to Dragonlord Placidusax so he actually spawns these exultation effects.

The Leonine Misbegotten of Castle Morne and Misbegotten Warrior of Redmane Castle once again wield their signature weapons. Restored the head lock-on point of the Ancestor Spirit.

Fixed Raytracing crashing issues with custom Reforged models such as the altered armors and Leonine Misbegotten.

Fixed some incorrect poise damage values on the hits of Curved Sword Charged R2 attacks.

Potentially fixed an issue with t-posing enemies in Stormhill.

Version 0.6.6C

Fixed the Briar sorcery blood loss effects not activating on enemies, making them much weaker than intended.

Fixed more minor text issues.

Fixed the Giant-Crushers incorrect Quality scaling.

Highlighted the exit path from Upper Nokstella Chair-Crypt with additional light fixtures, as it is now the mandatory progress path through the area.

Version 0.6.6B

Fixed broken scaling on the Alabaster Lord boss and Recusant Bernahl invader.

Fixed a broken roar hitbox on the Demi-Human Chieftans.

Fixed some flags that caused the door to Stormhawk Deenh to never open after a reset in the Eternal Return game mode. This fix may not be retroactive.

Fixed more Serpent-Hunter jump attack bugs.

Fixed two uninteractable rune pieces in the Mountaintops of the Giants.

Version 0.6.6

Updated to calibrations version 1.09.1.

Added Weighty Stones and Sanctified Stones, throwable rocks which can be crafted from Ruin Fragments and Sanctuary Stones. Sanctified Stones require the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook [2] from Kalé to craft.

Weighty Stones are functionally identical to the previous function of Ruin Fragments, which are now exclusively crafting materials. Sanctified Stones are a holy damage option for Strength throwables. Each Ruin Fragment and Sanctuary Stones yields more throwables now.

Increased the animation speed of the following skills:
    - Charge Forth
    - Troll's Roar
    - Storm Stomp
    - Hoarfrost Stomp
    - Storm Kick
    - Nebula
    - Thundercloud Form
    - Wolf's Assault
    - Wave of Gold
    - Claw Flick
    - Devourer of Worlds
    - Sorcery of the Crozier
    - Spearcall Ritual

Added some intelligence scaling to the Watchdog's Staff to synergize with the unique skill.

Updated all armors to their 1.07 poise values. This results in at least some poise for light cloth pieces, while heavy pieces remain mostly unchanged.

Made the Spirit Jellyfish a bit more aggressive when in their red fury mode.

Fixed the floating statue at the First Step.

Fixed the map marker of the Mt. Gelmir Merchant.

Fixed Tanith's Knight appearing early in Rykard's boss room.

Fixed issues with the Full Moon sorceries not applying their debuff most of the time.

Fixed another issue with the Full Moon spells.

Version 0.6.5B

Fixed the Setup UI Images for real this time with the above fixes.

Version 0.6.5A

https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/541?tab=files

Updated the Setup UI Images process to fix various bugs:

- Fixed shortcut quitting silently without informing users about their lack of .NET Desktop runtime.
- Fixed automatic Game folder resolution for users with Steam libraries that do not contain the word "Steam".
- Fixed manual location of Game folder giving an incorrect path.

Use the new "Setup UI Images (ELDEN RING Reforged)" shortcut. The old "Setup UI Images" shortcut can be deleted.

Additionally, Reforged will now be compatible to future UI mods released using ivi's Gideon mod-compatibility tool.
-
Going to NG+ will no longer remove restored Great Runes.

The Fortune of the Houses now also decreases stamina consumption while chaining spells.

The Preceptor's set now increases elemental defense.

Adjusted the cost of generator spells so that running out of FP is less likely.

Fixed many incorrect hit effects. Hitting with weapons should now always show the proper particle effect for the damage and status type the weapon inflicts. Some incorrect enemy hit effects were also fixed.

Fixed an issue where Flame of the Fell God could sometimes fail to hit enemies it was too close to.

Fixed an issue that caused the Stonedigger Troll and Great Snail enemies to drop 0 runes.

Fixed more text issues.

Version 0.6.5

High-quality Icons (for lore descriptions) are now bundled with the main mod archive. Instead of the 1.1GB HQ Icons download, you now only download ~80MB of compressed icons.

To apply the high-quality icons, you need to run the new shortcut "Setup UI Images" that is now found in the mod folder. Doing so will automatically grab and patch the big HQ icon archive from your ELDEN RING installation.

You only need to do this once, until the icons are updated for new items. Note that this requires .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0, which the shortcut should tell you how to download. If not, please report in ?tech-support.

As a side note, the high-quality icon installer also lets you install PS4 button prompts.

-

Removed the vanilla mechanic where Ash of War weapon skills can be performed at half their FP requirement. In return, adjusted most weapon skill FP costs downward.

Adjusted the queuing of the Duck action to be less likely to re-trigger accidentally.

Added limited Faith-based damage scaling to Law of Causality.

Added a Silent voice option for the player character that removes hit and death grunts/screams.

Many adjustments to multiple enemy hitboxes and attacks:
    - Decreased Castle Exile hitbox sizes to match other improved enemy hitboxes.
    - Slightly increased the size and damage of Starscourge Radahn hitboxes to be closer to vanilla.
    - Improved the tracking of Ulcerated Tree Spirits to make them more focused and less randomly flailing.
    - Decreased the damage of some of the Leonine Misbegottens outlier attacks and made the double hits slightly easier to dodge.

Added more variety to weathers:
    - Increased the chance for the very rare clear skies weather in most areas.
    - The Weeping Peninsula now has chances to have cloudy weather and heavy rain weather instead of just mild rain all the time.
    - Raya Lucaria now has small chances for no rain weather during the day and rainy weather at night. It was originally always rainy during the day and never rainy at night.
    - Caelid and the Mountaintops now have a small chance for very windy weather.
    - Mt. Gelmir now has a chance for heavy fog weather to appear.
    - Elphael now has a chance for light snow weather like the Haligtree Town has.

Added a Site of Grace setting for Seamless Coop which allows you to restock Binding Runes in case of Seamless bugs.

Added an escape portal to the arena of Dragonlord Placidusax to stop it from being an Adventure Mode softlock location.

-
Updated various strings, such as Millicent's armor set. Fixed various small issues in some texts in preparation for translations to other languages.

Fixed some issues with the Godskin Noble encounter in the Divine Tower of Liurnia where various actions could not be performed on the dynamic lift object.

Fixed an issue with the Nox Nightmaiden AI that caused it to always act as if it was on the hardest difficulty.

Fixed an issue with Depraved Perfumers where they'd frostbite themselves instead of imbibing Bloodboil Aromatic.

Fixed an issue where Explosive Greatbolts and Lighting Greatbolts did not correctly deal AoE damage.

    - Scarlet Papillon: Increased projectile tracking.

Added some extra flowers to make reaching Scarlet Papillon a bit easier.

Fixed Loretta's Enchanted Slash buff causing spells to deal 0 damage.

Fixed some randomizer compatability errors with ASSETENVIRONMENT and 1035540400 messages.

Fixed Godfrey in the Ashen Capital not initiating his phase 1.5.

Version 0.6.3A

Fixed the Scarlet Papillon spell costing a spell slot.

Fixed some issues with Rykard and Valiant Gargoyle attack tracking and hitboxes.

Version 0.6.3

Added three new spells: Creeping Rancor, Briars of Penance (by Bruhballs) and Scarlet Papillon (by Pina Colada), with Reforged tweaks and icons.
    - Creeping Rancor can be found on a hill in the Capital Outskirts near some golden skeletons.
    - Briars of Penance can be found by clearing an enemy camp full of Flamethrower Tanks outside of Fort Laeidd.  This camp also drops a Staff of the Guilty.
    - Scarlet Papillon can be found on top of the Heart of Aeonia, accessible from the path outside the Church of the Plague near the Swamp Lookout Tower.

Added two new Altered states for the Kaiden Armor: Kaiden Armor (Altered) and Kaiden Tunic. These altered pieces progressively strip more of the leather and armor scales from the original armor.

Added a Stake of Marika to the Grafted Scion fight at the Altar of Anticipation, active during the Four Belfries re-visit.

Counter frames have been globally extended 8 frames backwards across all player and enemy animations. Counter frames are windows of increased vulnerability to damage during the recovery of an attack. This change will extend this window to begin during the attack swing itself, making the player and enemies more punishable. The counter damage increase is a 10% increase to all damage taken except pierce damage which is 20%.

The Roar Medallion now additionally buffs Breath attacks by 7%. Originally, it only buffed Roar attacks by 14%. Greyoll's Roar is now also considered a Roar attack.

Added a new Site of Grace: Upper Nokstella Chair-Crypt.

Fixed some issues with the Eternal Return gamemode.

The Codex should hopefully be 100% completable now.

Added the ability to reset and ascend the Codex when it is completed to gain Codex prestige ranks. When the Codex is at 100% completion it can be reset, but you will keep the 10% rune reward buff on all enemies. The Codex can then be completed again for an additional 10% rune reward and more Starlight Tokens. The Codex can be ascended up to prestige 100 with a permanent 12x rune multiplier. Doing this is basically impossible, but it's a thing.

Fixed more un-interactable rune pieces.

Version 0.6.1C

Fixed all reported uninteractable rune pieces so far.

Fixed more enemy damage types. The Godskin Apostle now deals Slash damage instead of Standard. Rat bite attacks now deal Pierce instead of Standard. Many other enemies have already had their damage types fixed in ERR, but there seem to always be more to fix.

Fixed a vanilla issue where Greatbows would regenerate stamina during jump attacks.

 - More Damage: Gelmir's Fury, Bloodboon
 - Larger Hitbox: Gelmir's Fury, Swarm of Flies
 - Less Damage: Ranni's Dark Moon

Version 0.6.0D

Fixed a broken rune piece near the Warmaster's Shack.

Fixed the Runic Trace item rarity.

Version 0.6.0A

Some important fixes for the runeforging system.

Version 0.6.0

Introduced a new progression system: Runeforging. The Lands Between are now rich with new collectibles in the form of Rune Pieces, found around obscure and hidden edges of the world. Restore a Great Rune and present twenty Rune Pieces to Finger Reader Enia to unlock the Runeforging system.

Runeforging allows to forge twenty Rune Pieces into Binding Runes, a new category of item which grants passive boosts when in the inventory. These range from stat increases to improvements in various values like spell costs, poise damage or movement speed.

Each restored Great Rune unlocks a wider variety of Binding Runes to choose from, themed in accordance to the Demigod whose power binds them.

Binding Runes may be broken back down into their Rune Piece constituents, so that they may be re-allocated via Runeforging.

Starting in NG+, an Ascended selection of Binding Runes becomes available, extending character progression beyond the Rune Level cap.

Reaching the level cap of 200 now allows to purchase further Rune Pieces at the Site of Grace in lieu of leveling up. Bosses in NG+ will also drop Rune Pieces.

Gameplay:
Jump attacks performed when falling from a height beyond 3 meters are now considered "plunge attacks" which deal increased damage, increased poise damage, and have enhanced staggering abilities, often pancaking lesser enemies. Not to be confused with classic Dark Souls plunge criticals.

The Longtail Cat Talisman now additionally prevents the character from performing landing animations when falling from greater heights, allowing for faster traversal. It also increases plunge attack damage.

Inflicting deathblight and madness now causes enemies to flinch in the same way that afflicting frostbite or bloodloss does.

Fortunes:
Fortune effects have been updated and streamlined. Read the description of each Fortune to find out what was changed.

Added many new status icons to Fortune effects.

Spells:
Added two new spells in the cold sorcery school, Glintstone Snowdrift and Moonchill. They can be acquired by providing a sorcery vendor with the new item Ranni's Scroll, which can be found by completing the new "Falling Sky" painting located in Redmane Castle.

Many updates to spells to improve underperforming ones in small ways.
    - Increased hitbox size of Frozen Lightning Spear, Burn O Flame!, Death Lightning, and Litany of Proper Death to make them more consistent.
    - Slight damage increases to some spells like Glintstone Cometshard, Adula's Moonblade, and Magma Shot.
    - Slight speed increases to some spells like Carian Greatsword and Beast Claw.

Fixed an issue that caused the Fire's Deadly Sin damage over time effect to not scale damage based on Faith. The Faith and Intelligence scaling of Fire's Deadly Sin, Carian Retaliation, and Starlight has also been improved to scale more effectively at 20, 40, 60, and 80 of their respective scaling stats.

Adjusted Magma sorcery requirements. The Faith requirements are now more of a flavorful suggestion, and Intelligence requirements are more in line with the Gelmir Glintstone Staff. This also applies to the Blasphemous Blade.

Generator spells are now marked with a blue tear on their icon, signifying their FP restoration.

Consumables:
Greases and Drawstring Greases were merged into one. Greases now apply to both weapons simultaneously (if they are viable buff targets). Greases now use the fast Drawstring Grease animation, and last for 30 seconds.

Dramatically lowered the resource costs of crafting Greases. Drawstring Greases and Roped Pots have been removed from the crafting system, but remain in your inventory until used.

Drawstring Greases around the world have been replaced by regular Greases. Strings around the world have been replaced by Human Bone Shards and Eyes of Death. Demi-Humans no longer drop Strings. Strings can safely be discarded from the inventory.

Enemies:
Moved the Dectus Medallion from Fort Faroth to Fort Gael. Fort Faroth has regained its Dragonbarrow tier scaling. Also increased the strength of Battlemage Hughues to match Dragonbarrow scaling.

Fixed two vanilla bugs that would cause some boss attacks to deal double damage. Fixed Rennala's Star Shower attack hitting twice per individual projectile. Fixed Rykard's phase 1 ground attack hitting twice.

Fixed a bug where the Fire Giant would regenerate more health than intended on harder difficulties. Also cut the healing each Godskin enemy in the Godskin Duo fight receives in half.

Draconic Tree Sentinel lightning strikes now display indicator visuals to inform the player. The Erdtree Avatar in northern Liurnia has also received some visual updates to the magic geyser effect it has.

Other:
Added a new site of grace to the Shack of the Lofty area.

Added a double spiritspring jump to the west of the Shaded Castle, creating a new path to Mt. Gelmir. Added a quintuple spiritspring jump behind the Church of Vows, creating a faster path up and down Liurnia's cliffsides.

Completing any painting now awards 10 Signs of the All-Knowing in addition to the standard loot it normally gives.

The "Resurrect bosses" menu at Roundtable Hold has been expanded to cover all bosses in the game.

The Witch's Glintstone Crown will now appear broken if received after siding with Jerren against Sellen.

Fixed the "aim punch" bug.

Fixed jump attacks not chaining to the correct R1 followup attack.

Fixed the Torrent jump sound being cut off, for good this time.

Added some potential fixes for Blaidd getting stuck at the Radahn Festival.

Updated the title screen with a new official logo.

Updated the in-game UI with a new Reforged color scheme and accents.

Issues with the UI have been addressed. FP costs for weapon skills will now display their full numbers, stat scalings like A+, B+, C+ etc. now display correctly, and the Spirit Ashes summon area indicator has been restored.

Added more status icons for common effects such as Torrent restrictions, movement speed and damage bubbles.

Version 0.5.13A

Fixed an issue with the Codex that could cause it to not work when on Normal difficulty.

Version 0.5.13

Fixed many enemies unintentionally having the ability to randomly get golden eyes. This includes things like wildlife and the nomad traders.

Fixed the Twin Maiden Husk not selling Lord's Divine Fortification when it should.

Fixed an issue where enemies who spawn in dead could count for Codex completion progress. Enemies will now need to be damaged before they can count. This will also improve performance when loading into an area with many enemies that are instantly killed off like Rennala's boss room.

Added some events that should prevent the phase 1 Fire Giant from falling out of the map in Seamless Co-op.

Version 0.5.12

Important performance fixes for certain areas.

Slightly increased the speed of some fist powerstance/two hand attacks.

Improved the hitboxes of the Ancestral Follower enemies.

Added many missing enemy variants to the Codex. Also decreased the cost of crafting Signs and increased the amount of Signs on the chair corpses.

Adjusted the Crucible Fortune's effect balancing a bit and added an exception so that the fire damage reduction doesn't affect the Breath Aspect spell. The Horn buff is less effective and the Tail buff is slightly more effective.

Updated enemies with glowing eyes a bit, fixing the bug that caused some bosses to have glowing eyes and increasing the chances lower tier/easier enemies have glowing eyes.

Fixed a lingering visual effect when using Frozen Dragonbolt spell or the Ice Lightning Slash skill when in water.

Fixed some more flag bugs with NG+ and Eternal Return, like the Fire Giant's defeat flag not resetting. Also fixed some more flag bugs with Quick Start.

    - Briars of Guilt is a new Aberrant Sorcery that can be found in the Mountaintops of the Giants, from an enemy camp right after the Zamor Ruins area.
    - Poison Bolt is a new Servant of Rot Incantation that can be found on a hill near the Caelid Waypoint Ruins.

Updated the spell icon of Javelin of Gold. Greatly improved the consistency of Scouring Black Flame.

Added a new Fortune. The Fortune of the Warmaster drops from the Bell-bearing Hunter at the Warmaster's Shack.

The Artificer fortune now gains a very slight amount of buildup to its buff from crossbow attacks.

Added some item recovery events for important key items. If the Oracle Effigy or Codex of the All-Knowing items have been received before, but somehow disappear from the player's inventory and bottomless box, they will automatically be given to the player when loading in. Also added the Spirit Calling Bell and Codex to the Quick Start option.

Added a bit more team AI to the Cleanrot Knight duo boss. Also improved the Godskin duo AI a bit more.

Leyndell can now be entered via Deeproot Depths without having two Great Runes.

Fixed an issue that could cause Radahns defeat flag to not reset in NG+ and Eternal Return.

Fixed some performance issues caused by the Bestiary.

Updated the title screen.

"Exploration" difficulty was changed. Enemies now only get up to Master-level health, while dealing ~10% less damage than Normal mode. Their poise and status resistances were also scaled back to Hard difficulty levels. Bosses remain fully "Hard" level.

You can now powerstance:
- Axes with Hammers
- Greataxes with Greathammers

Raised the shortcut cliff from Caelid to Dragonbarrow to eliminate the shortcut. Dragonbarrow must now be accessed through Sellia, Town of Sorcery.

Some weapon projectile attacks (like Dark Moon Greatsword) now also have a hitbox for the actual weapon.

Version 0.5.08A

Fixed Melina not appearing to leave when entering Leyndell or to give the Rold Medallion after Morgott when using Quick Start. For players on existing characters, interacting with the impenetrable thorns will fix this issue.

Fixed some missing text on the "Begin next Journey" prompt that appears after the credits.

Version 0.5.08

Added a new spirit ash. The spirit ash "Latenna and Lobo" can be obtained at the Apostate Derelict.

Increased the amount of smithing stones obtained from lower level smithing stone drops in areas that are above that level of smithing stone. For example, the two Smithing Stone [4] drops in Deeproot Depths now drop 3 Smithing Stone [4] instead of just 1.

Added new camera parameters for Mohg's phase 2. Slightly decreased the hitbox size and duration of the large fire puddle to make it easier to fight when using melee.

Fixed an issue where the Godskin Duo individual enemies could respawn with more or less than 50% HP when the difficulty was changed. This was due to the difficulty modifiers not persisting after the enemy dies, and the reapplication of those modifiers only happening after the enemy lost 50% of its health.

Fixed the Crucible Fortune not reducing the duration of regular buffs.

Fixed an issue with the Guardian Swordspear's Night and Blessed affinities having the wrong scaling.

Version 0.5.07D

Fixed an issue where Preceptor Miriam dropped way mores runes than intended.

Decreased the health and defense penalty of the Rogue fortune.

Decreased the recovery time of all backstep/duck attacks. Added some better attack followups to random attacks like the 1H Greatsword Backstep -> R1 and 2H Fist Backstep -> R1.

Increased the speed of some parts of the Twinblade 2H R1 animations.

Raised the maximum level on NG+7 from 251 to 301. The maximum level increases more per NG+ now.

Fixed an issue where Flying Dragons and Magma Wyrms weren't taking extra damage when attacking the head, making them tankier than intended.

Version 0.5.04

Updated Vigor scaling and enemy damage scaling slightly to make the early game a bit easier.

Added a complete enemy bestiary. The Codex of the All-Knowing is a new item that can be acquired in the Roundtable Hold from a chest outside of Sir Gideon's room. This chest also contains the Knowledge Seeker's Cookbook [1].
Using the cookbook, players can craft consumable items called Signs of the All-Knowing. This item marks targeted enemies in combat, and if a marked target is killed its information will be added to the Codex. The Codex of the All-Knowing can be looked through at Sites of Grace, where it will show all of your collected knowledge on enemies and blank entries for every unknown enemy.
There are over 350 entries to collect for all the enemies and their different variations, and total Codex progress is viewable with a percentage based tracker. Collecting Codex entries for enemies will increase the amount of runes they drop. Additionally, every 25% of the Codex completed will award a Starlight Token, which can be exchanged for any other item in the game.

The Codex of the All-Knowing, Oracle Effigy, Whetstone Knife, and Tailoring Tools can now be deposited into storage. When in storage, the Site of Grace menu options for these items will be removed, making the menu more customizable.

The Oracle Effigy item is now obtained in a different way. Instead of buying it from Kale, it can now be obtained immediately by interacting with one of the Summoning Pool effigy statues. This drop replaces the Small Golden Effigy drop that was originally on these statues. Oracle's Remedy items can still be purchased from merchants to unlock more common Fortunes.

Added a Quick Start option to the Altar of Anticipation. This option will immediately warp the player to the Roundtable Hold after dying to or defeating the Grafted Scion. This option also automatically gives the player Torrent and disables Vanilla tutorials.

Greatly increased Torrent's movement speed while decreasing his health and increasing the player's vulnerability while riding. This will make traveling long distances less boring while making sure he isn't too effective in combat.

Added a level cap. The base NG now has a level cap of 201, increasing up to 251 with NG+s. With this mechanic, the scaling of stats has been completely rebalanced.
    - Vigor, Mind, and Endurance will now give more HP, FP, and stamina beyond the original softcap of 60. Players can invest into these stats for more specialization, but it will cost level ups that could have been invested into other stats.
    - Split scaling weapons and catalysts have been updated to be more effective by requiring a similar level of investment compared to single stat scaling gear. For example, a catalyst that scales off of one stat will want 99 of INT or FTH, but a catalyst that scales off of both would only want about 50 or 60 in each.
    - Enemy rune drops have been increased to make level 201 a more realistically achievable level in NG.
    - Many Somberstone weapons have had their damage and scaling values rebalanced with these changes.
Existing characters are still completely usable with this update, but may be a bit underleveled compared to the new recommended levels.

The Starlight spell now gets slightly more effective FP regen at 40 Intelligence and then again at 70 Intelligence. The Carian Retaliation and Fire's Deadly Sin spell effectiveness increase requirements were also changed from 30/60 Intelligence or Faith to 40/70.

All pot consumables now have Arcane damage scaling. The base damage of throwing pots has also been increased.

Swapped the drop positions of the Greatbow and Erdtree Greatbow.

Fixed all of the arrows that should not have been dealing pierce damage but were. Any arrow that says it doesn't deal pierce should now properly deal the displayed damage type. This includes Lightning Arrows/Bolts, Shattershard Arrows, and Rainbow Stone Arrows.

Fixed a bug that could cause the Lightning Strike incantation to hit very inconsistently.

Fixed an issue that caused certain NPC enemies like the Bloody Finger Nerijus to take less damage than intended.

Fixed the broken tracking on the Rancor spell.

Fixed a broken NPCparam entry on the Highwayman and some Itemlotparam entries that messed with the randomizer.

Version 0.4.9C

Updated the Nox Nightmaiden fight event scripts for hopefully better Co-op compatability.

Fixed Torrent's jump sound again.

Fixed an issue with guardbreaks on certain animations.

Version 0.4.9B

Further balance adjustments to the Nox Nightmaiden:
    - Decreased the strength of the Prelate.
    - Fixed an issue with the spawn position of the Assassin.
    - Adjusted the spawn positions of the mimic tears to be closer to the center of the arena.
    - Made it slightly easier to strafe the mist attack.
    - Made the Nox Nightmaiden AI less aggressive on Normal and Easy AI settings.

Version 0.4.9A

Greatly decreased the target priority of the Nox Nightmaiden when her mimic tears are active, for spirit ash targeting. Slightly decreased the HP of the mimic tears.

Fixed the spell slot cost on Rancor.

Version 0.4.9

Added two new spells.
    - "Volcanic Storm" is a magma sorcery that can be found next to Alexander when he visits Mt. Gelmir. The spell unleashes a magma storm in an area around the caster as long as the button is held.
    - "Rancor" is a death generator sorcery that shoots a single homing skull. It is dropped by a powerful skeleton to the west of the Church of Irith.

Added two new weapons.
    - The "Grave Spear" weapon is the spear wielded by the skeleton enemies, and inflicts frostbite. It drops from these enemies as well.
    - The "Nightmaiden's Edge" weapon is the dagger wielded by Nox nightmaidens.

Added a new boss fight in the Night's Sacred Grounds area. The Nox Nightmaiden boss guards the Fingerslayer Blade and drops the Nightmaiden's Edge.  This boss has some complicated scripts that control the fight, so if there are any syncing issues or bugs in the boss when using Seamless Co-op please report them.

Added a small amount of innate Madness buildup to all 4 Celebrant's weapons. The enemies now inflict some Madness too. The Celebrant's Ribrake has also been updated to deal slash damage instead of pierce.

Updated the hitboxes of the Sanguine Noble, Dominula Celebrant, and Nox Nightmaiden enemies.

Fixed some incorrect icons for things like Frenzybone Arrows and Lightning Arrows. Also added new icons for the Altered Spellblade's Pointed Hat and Witch's Skirt.

Fixed the Fire and Lightning affinity extra effects not working on the Butchering Knife.

Fixed an issue that caused many spirit ashes to have very low eyesight due to changes made in 1.08 to spirit ashes for the colosseum.

Fixed the weird way Gideon holds the Scepter of the All-Knowing.

Version 0.4.87A

Fixed a bug that could disable boss healthbars.

Fixed a bug that could randomly prevent Astel from entering phase 2.

Version 0.4.87

Added more settings to the "Change settings" menu:
    - Time of day death storage: Enabled by default. This is what allows the time of day to change and pass when you die instead of always resetting to morning like vanilla. The only real reason to disable this is when using Seamless Co-op.
    - Automatic Melina appeareance: Enabled by default. If Melina is in your party, she will automatically appear at any Site of Grace.

    - SC: Always spectate: Adds a boss healthbar to the bottom of the screen that basically makes Seamless Co-op always spectate. A bit janky, but its fun to have and works mostly fine. The boss healthbar that is on the bottom of the screen is linked to your own health when there isn't a real boss fight happening.
    - SC: Shared death: If one player dies, every nearby player dies.

Updated the hitboxes of the Fallen Hawk Soldier enemies.

Updated the Scepter of the All-Knowing to look and be held more like a staff.

Added a slight range difference between 1H and 2H crossbow shots.

Fixed an issue where the powerstance L1 input could not execute falling attacks, most noticeable with the Raptor of the Mists AoW.

Fixed the Erdtree Seal not having its Erdtree incantation damage boost effect.

Fixed the Church of Vows missing walls.

Fixed some locations that could get the player stuck in Adventure mode:
    - Fixed the broken "Return to entrance" mini-grace in the Lakeside Crystal Cave. It being broken seems to be a vanilla bug.
    - Added a warp out of the Divine Tower of Limgrave.
    - Added a path out of Jarburg, involving tombstones and some very hard Torrent parkour.

Version 0.4.86

Added a new spell made by Bruhballs. The Bolt of Gransax spell is an incantation version of the unique weapon skill. It is dropped from a Leyndell Knight found outside the gates of the Royal Capital in the Capital Outskirts area.

Updated the icon for the Singularity spell to better match the visual.

Increased the speed of 2H Twinblade R1 attacks and improved the R2 to R1 followup animations. Increased the speed of Spear R1 attacks. Improved the followup animations of some Greatsword and Katana animations when alternating between R1 and R2.

The Concealing Veil now applies a slight sight reduction to enemies when crouching.

Added some base guard boost to the Unarmed "weapons" so that the left hand block feature works with your unarmed fists.

Added Altered variants of the Spellblade's Pointed Hat and Snow Witch Skirt that alter parts of the model.

Improved the hitboxes of the Beastman enemies and some Skeleton type enemies.

Fixed the stat point adjustments of the Dynasts Fortune.

Version 0.4.85A

Fixed some issues with the drop and equipping of the new Dynasts Fortune.

Fixed the title screen version number.

Increased the stability of the coil shield to match other small shields.

Version 0.4.85

Added a new fortune. The Fortune of the Dynasts is a legendary blood-based Fortune that drops from an invader in the Siofra River area.

Added new status icons for deflecting, parrying, the Spellsword fortune, and the new Dynasts fortune.

Reduced the overly long ending lag of many R2 attacks. Also added some different combos from R2s to R1s that better fit, like making the Zweihander R2-2 attack transition to a better looking R1 attack. Also increased the speed of sub/transition animations, like the transition from certain R1 attacks to the first R2 attack.

I went over every heavy attack in the game, and there are a lot, so be sure to check out the dozens of unique heavy attacks this game has that were kind of bad before. Some attacks, like the Iron Cleaver heavies, were so slow they were basically bugged.

Other unique attacks like the Pickaxe running R2 attacks were also adjusted to perform better.

Updated difficulty settings to use a new method to apply effects to enemies, this means there is no longer an invisible bullet being fired that triggers certain things like the flamethrow pillars in the catacombs.

Added new special effects for co-op scaling for 5 and 6 players that should work with the new Seamless Co-op update.

Fixed some issues with the new Deflect implementation. Pressing L1 while in a situation where you can't block like on Torrent or being grabbed by an enemy will no longer consume stamina. The Carian Knight's Sword R2 attacks and Barricade skill have also been fixed to use this updated Deflect.

Fixed some issues with the "Left hand block" setting. NPCs will no longer have this feature enabled.

Fixed an issue that would cause Torrent's dash to reset very quickly.

Fixed the door at the Frenzied Flame Proscription staying closed after triggering the cutscene.

Version 0.4.83B

Fixed an issue where the Starlight spell granted infinite FP.

Version 0.4.83A

Fixes the missing sound when performing a deflect.

Also slightly increased the smithing stone tiers of some merchants and dungeon completion drops. Modified the rune cost of upgrading weapons to be an equal 30k for all weapons instead of almost nothing for certain weapons and around 100k for heavy weapons.

Version 0.4.83

Updated the Exploration Mode difficulty to fix minibosses and certain elite enemies getting the full stat boost.

Improved stealth by reducing the range of the sound created by jumping. Reduced the sound range of critical attacks like backstabs. Increased the enemy vision cone angle reduction while crouched.

Mohg's Great Rune now decreases status effect buildup taken instead of doing nothing.

Potentially improved the consistency of the Spark Aromatic for people who are experiencing a strange bug where it does nothing.

Version 0.4.83

Updated the Exploration Mode difficulty to fix minibosses and certain elite enemies getting the full stat boost.

Improved stealth by reducing the range of the sound created by jumping. Reduced the sound range of critical attacks like backstabs. Increased the enemy vision cone angle reduction while crouched.

Mohg's Great Rune now decreases status effect buildup taken instead of doing nothing.

Potentially improved the consistency of the Spark Aromatic for people who are experiencing a strange bug where it does nothing.

Version 0.4.82A

Adds a warp point out of Castle Morne for Adventure mode and decreased the unintentionally large hitbox size of the charged Comet spell.

Version 0.4.82

Updated deflects. Mashing the block button will now consume much less stamina, but will disable perfect deflects for a short duration. Perfect deflects and regular deflect windows can now be identified with the slightly different icon. The square background icon is a perfect deflect, and the diamond is a deflect.

Added a new menu at the site of grace. Under "Change difficulty" is the new "Change settings" menu. This menu has some settings that can be toggled, there are currently two.
    - "Left hand block" can enable blocking with weapons in the left hand instead of attacking. This works with powerstanced weapons to enable blocking while powerstancing.
    - "Clear material recipes" will make it so that the recipes for intermediate materials are periodically cleared from the recipe list if you have none of the required base material. This is how the recipes currently function, it now just needs to be toggled in this menu.

Updated and sorted some crafting recipes. Certain materials now convert into less or more intermediate materials.

Improved the consistency of the Spark Aromatic, making it easier to get max damage, especially against smaller targets.

Added an enemy camp chest to the enemy camp by the Liurnia Lake Shore grace.

Improved the hitboxes of the spear and scythe skeleton enemies.

Fixed an issue where the Black Flame spell wouldn't apply a Black Flame effect on a direct hit with the fireball.

Fixed the Alabaster Lord's missing rune reward.

Fixed an issue where Torrent would not be properly re-enabled after using the Grand Lift of Rold.

Also fixed an event that would disable the coffin warp to Ainsel River from Deeproot Depths while the Seamless Co-op mod was being used. This seems to be a bug caused by Seamless Co-op, but editing the event can still fix it.

Potentially fixed the low health spirit summon bug when using Seamless Co-op.

Version 0.4.81

Updated the mod to calibrations version 1.08.1.

Fixed some recipes and text.

Check the post above for the full 0.4.8 patchnotes

Version 0.4.8

Crafting has been overhauled. Collected materials must now be crafted into intermediate forms (alchemics, substances, extracts or amalgamates) which replace the original materials in all crafting recipes. This leads to more variety in sources for certain kinds of material, making crafting more accessible.

Recipes for these new items unlock dynamically as you find materials to craft from. Amounts were also tweaked to be more forgiving.

Added a new Eye of Death material that drops from Basilisks for the updated crafting system. It can be made into the Blighted Extract item.
    - "Alchemic" items can be made from generic materials.
    - "Substance" items can be made from elemental materials.
    - "Extract" items can be made from status related materials.
    - "Amalgamate" items can be made from other materials.

Feedback is welcome as the system has just been implemented, and so the balancing is in an early stage.

Alternate forms of items like roped pots, poison darts, and drawstring greases can now be crafted with the original version of the item. For example, a Drawstring Grease can now be crafted with 1 of the original grease and 1 string.

The high quality icons file has been updated with all of the new icons added in 0.4.8.

Added a new spell. "Singularity" is a gravity sorcery that pulls a target in and then explodes. It can be found by defeating a new Alabaster Lord boss who utilizes the spell, near the Church of the Plague.

The Javelin of Gold spell projectile will now properly stick to the ground before exploding when charged. Like the boss version, this does not happen on a direct hit against an enemy.

Also fixed an issue where the difficulty selection menu wouldn't automatically close when unselecting the currently selected difficulty.

Fixed the Dragonbarrow Isolated Merchant's shop flags that triggered and disabled the uchigatana when buying the spiked caestus.

Fixed some enemies that could unintentionally be rotted or poisoned.

Version 0.4.76

Added a passive effect to the Mausoleum Knight armor set that decreases status effect buildup taken.

Fixed Swift Glintstone Shard. Fixed the two handed rolling attack of great spear weapons. Both of these completely broke when updating to 1.08.

Fixed issues with enemy health regeneration on harder difficulties. It will now properly be halted for a duration when an enemy is hit.

Version 0.4.75

Organized the difficulty selection menu and added in-game explanations of difficulties that will appear when selecting the mode while Tutorials are enabled. This includes a rating of the overall difficulty of the mode, which should help players choose the right difficulty for them. Also added the Adept and Exploration difficulty modes.

The Deathbed Smalls now drop along with the Deathbed Dress.

Millicent's Set now drops at the end of her quest, whether you help or kill her. The robes can be altered to the tunic, and the gloves can be altered to the prosthesis.

Fixed Bestial Sling.

Fixed Torrent's jump sound.

Fixed an issue where the parry hitbox could make sparks when hitting collision.

Version 0.4.74

Decreased the window to queue inputs for certain dagger to attacks. This will help avoid accidental attack inputs when pressing the attack button multiple times, as you do with daggers.

Decreased the speed at which unactivated status effects applied to enemies drain. Also went over some mob enemy stats and decreased their status resistances where appropriate

Melina will now instantly transition to the level up animation without dialogue after collecting one Great Rune.

Fixed some issues with crouching attacks on weapons that were changed with 1.08. The bug where weapons in the offhand can mess up crouch attacks of the main hand weapon is a vanilla bug and is not something I can fix myself.

Fixed the missing hair style icons.

Version 0.4.73

Updated to game version 1.08.

Added a new game mode. The Adventure game mode is a mode that replaces fast traveling with set warp points. There are 34 warp gates that can be used to travel between different places of interest in the Lands Between.

Increased the speed of some parry animations and adjusted parry frames. The exact parry frames are still visible by the shield icon that appears.

Updated boss drops. The Fallen Cavalry now drops a "No Skill" Ash of War. The Dragonbarrow Night's Cavalry now drops a new "Spinning Chain" Ash of War. The Spinning Chain Ash of War currently lacks a unique icon, but it works.

Improved the very weird lighting in the Fell Twins boss room.

Fixed the Digger's Staff and Gravel Stone Seal investment levels. They now require a bit less stat investment to get higher scaling, like the other split catalysts. Also improved their scaling and the scaling of the Staff of the Guilty and Scepter of the All-Knowing slightly.

With a new game version and a new game mode there are probably gonna be some bugs, so please report those in #bug-reports

Version 0.4.72

Added a new mechanic to enemy encampments, which were originally kind of useless in vanilla. Enemy camps will now contain powerful red-eyed enemies guarding a locked chest. Defeating all of the red-eyed guardians will unlock the chest, which contains gear enemies usually randomly drop, now guaranteed.

Combat with a red-eyed guardian disables Torrent and increases the alertness of all other enemies in the camp, so be careful when approaching enemy camps, or don't approach them at all. A tutorial will also pop up ingame when engaging with camps for the first time.

There are currently around 14 camps in the overworld that each drop 2 pieces of gear each from the special chest. There are also 2 special chests in the Haligtree with extra drops. More will be added over time.

Unique weapon skill updates:
    - Improved Regal Roar's slam hitbox and fixed an issue where it could miss targets too close to the player.
    - Greatly increased the hitbox size of both Storm Kick hitboxes so they actually match the visual effect size.
    - Added the missing status resistance debuff to the Shriek of Milos mentioned in the description.
    - Increased the animation speed and knockback distance of the Alabaster Lord's Pull and Onyx Lord's Rejection. Also fixed some vanilla bugs with the hitboxes that could cause them to push or pull the incorrect distance.
    - Fixed some vanilla bugs where the bullets of certain skills, like Nebula, could tick inconsistently.
    - Adjusted the hitboxes and damage sources of multiple other skills to better match the actual damage source, and fixed a lot of inconsistencies with somber skills in general.

Renamed the Barricade Shield to just Barricade. It can now be equipped on all armaments. It no longer buffs your weapon but instead allows you to enter a stance that can deflect, making deflects possible when not two handing.

Fixed an issue where Stone Sling traveled a way shorter distance than intended when cast with a catalyst in the right hand.

Added one (1) Starlight Token available upon returning to the Chapel of Anticipation. This allows you to select one piece of gear, so choose wisely. To compensate, the Grafted Scion has had its level increased.

Map markers will now appear on the compass from much further away.

Decreased the HP of Rykard while decreasing the damage the Serpent-Hunter does, making other types of damage a bit more viable. He still has way more HP than a regular boss though. Also fixed Rkyard's scaling so that he actually takes less damage and scales properly when co-oping with 4 people, the vanilla events didn't support 4 players.

Fixed an issue where Maliketh could inflict more Destined Death on the player than intended with his weapon skill attack that creates a slashing AoE.

Fixed an issue where some of Malenia's phase 2 thrust attacks were triggering more health restoration than intended.

Added some missing events that should potentially fix an issue where Magma Wyrms and Ancient Dragons could get double hits by hitting with both an attack's melee hitbox and aoe on the same frame.

Version 0.4.71

Added two new generator spells.
Stone Sling is a simplified Rock Sling spell and can be found from the Alabaster Lord at the Crater-Pocked Glade. The Crater-Pocked Glade has also had a cut mechanic restored where the meteors will only glow, and the Alabaster Lord will only spawn, at night.
Golden Star is a simple incantation that fires a weak golden star with high tracking. This incantation can be found at the very bottom of the map, beyond the Morne Moangrave.
The high quality icons file has been updated to include new icons for these spells made by ivi.

Thop's Barrier will now push enemies back and stagger them when cast, and increased the size of the spell deflection hitbox to make it more reliable. Also increased the hitbox size of the Shatter Earth, Rock Blaster, Catch Flame, and O Flame! spells slightly.

The Staff of the Guilty is now a Dual Catalyst like the Scepter of the All-Knowing. It scales off of Intelligence and Faith.

Added Strength + Intelligence sorcery scaling to the Digger's Staff. Added Dexterity + Faith incantation scaling to the Gravel Stone Seal. These catalysts are not as strong as the Glintblade Staff and Clawmark Seal, but provide a unique type of scaling.

The Erdtree Seal now boosts the damage of Erdtree incantations. This includes Wrath of Gold, Elden Stars, and Golden Star.

Marika's Hammer now has the thrust attacks of the Morning Star, making the weapon moveset more similar to Radagon's moveset.

The Fire Prelate Helm can now be Altered to toggle the fire effect on or off.

Irina's corpse will now disappear when Hyetta's quest activates.

Added a Site of Grace to the area before Astel's boss arena, the Underground's End.

Version 0.4.7D

Decreased the weight values of all talisman from 0.2-1.6 to 0.1-1.2.

Increased the effectiveness of generators and decreased the effectiveness of Cerulean Flasks at high levels of upgrade. Cerulean Flasks will be the same effectiveness or even more effective at lower upgrade levels.

Fortunes can now be stored. Stored Fortunes will not appear on the selection menu. Active Fortunes can not be stored, but you can store the inactive version of an active Fortune, and this will prevent you from selecting it in the menu too.

Fixed issues with the Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella that prevented it from spawning. Hopefully there are no more issues that make me want to release another small update to fix it.

Version 0.4.7C

Added stagger immunity to Crucible Knights, Grave Warden Duelists, and Leonine Misbegottens during attacks where they are in the air to avoid awkward staggers.

Decreased the Arcane penalty of the Crucible Fortune from 10 to 6.

Fixed an issue that could make certain enemies/duo bosses ignore teamAttack (the thing that makes them not attack at the same time).

Version 0.4.7B

Fixed an issue that could make Magma weapons insanely overpowered by allowing them to deal bonus damage against Frostbitten targets while not removing the Frostbite when buffed with a non-fire elemental weapon buff, allowing for each hit to take off large percentages of a bosses health at once.

Version 0.4.7A

Increased the FP generation from generator spells at lower levels of Mind by making it less reliant on max FP, and slightly increased it at higher Mind too.

Balanced the FP cost to damage ratio between Glintstone Stars, Star Shower, and Stars of Ruin. This is an increase to damage to Glintstone Stars, a larger increase to damage to Star Shower, and a decrease to damage to Stars of Ruin.

Fixed the Bloody Slash skill on more weapons.

Fixed the rune reward of the new Crucible Knight boss.

Fixed an issue that caused the Dragonkin Soldier of Nokron to be immortal and not die when its HP reached 0.

Version 0.4.7

Added the high quality item icons. These can be found in a separate download in the #info channel or as an optional file on Nexus. The 00_solo files go in the "menu > hi" folder

Fortunes have received a big visual upgrade with new item icons made by ivi.

Added two new fortunes.
The rare Fortune of Haima drops from Battlemage Hugues.
The legendary Fortune of the Crucible drops from the Crucible Knight that can be fought from the Four Belfries. This Crucible Knight is now a special late game boss with an advanced moveset.

Added a new spell. Frozen Dragonbolt applies an ice lightning weapon buff to your right hand weapon and unleashes a burst of ice lightning at the same time. Spell made by Bruhballs and icon by ivi. Drops from the Dragonkin Soldier of Nokron.

Increased the speed of the cast animation of Loretta's Greatbow and Mastery slightly.
Decreased the damage of Meteorite and Meteorite of Astel.
Fixed an issue with Dragonbolt Blessing. The small stagger resistance now actually works.
Increased the equip load buff of Vyke's Dragonbolt from 1.15x to 1.2x.
Increased the animation speed of the Aspect of the Crucible Incantations.

Increased the animation speed of the Stormcaller and Thunderstorm skills.
Fixed an issue with Bloody Slash that made it cause no blood loss buildup, and increased its animation speed.

Increased the animation speed of some twinblade 2H and Powerstance light attacks.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Ash of War duplication menu to not appear or function properly.

Version 0.4.69

Updated the player's version of Frostbite to be stackable like Poison and Rot are. Instead of a 20% debuff for 30 seconds, it now has a 10% debuff for 50 seconds. Fire damage will still remove all Frostbite. With this change all status effects can begin reapplying instantly after they activate, except for Sleep which has a unique animation and can only begin once the enemy wakes up.

The empty Miniature Ranni item can now be upgraded to the Lunar Princess' Exultation. This talisman boosts damage negation when frostbite occurs in the vicinity. This secret talisman can be found after discovering all of the stars, with the empty Miniature Ranni in your inventory.

The Kindred of Rot's Exultation now triggers healing instead of boosting damage. The Lord of Blood's Exultation still boosts damage.

Vyke's War Spear now has the all-stat scaling the Frenzied Affinity and Seal have.

Added Glintblade Hail, the Prodigious Crown Pendant, and Lunar Princess' Exultation to the early NG+ shop.

Added the Fortune of the Commoner. It's very common.

Finally fixed the Margit and Mohg's Shackle items. Both shackles now have the same range of 100 meters. Mohg also no longer takes 20% extra damage when shackled (Margit/Morgott never took extra damage). Mohg's phantom can not be shackled.

Version 0.4.68

Adjustments to some sorceries.
 - Briars of Sin: Increased animation speed.

 - Crystal Barrage: Added a small stagger to the hits. Improved the consistency of the spell by decreasing the spread of the bullets. Decreased the FP cost of channeling it to account for the lower total damage and poise damage.

 - Crystal Release: Increased the range, damage, and poise damage of the initial release hit and improved the consistency of the released shards by increasing their hitbox size.

 - Gavel of Haima: Increased damage.

 - Loretta's Mastery: Fixed an issue that caused only one arrow to work. The spell can now hit with up to two arrows, either of the top two and either of the bottom two. This doesn't affect the damage much as the damage was lowered to account for two hits instead of one, but it is slightly more damaging now.

 - Magic Downpour: Improved consistency through more tracking and a larger hitbox size on the projectiles. Projectiles now pierce targets. Increased damage slightly.

 - Meteorite: Now fires a single homing meteorite. Meteorites now damage targets at a consistent rate.

 - Meteorite of Astel: Now fires a set of three homing meteorites. Meteorites now damage targets at a consistent rate.

Fixed the Meteoric Ore Blade and Onyx/Alabaster Lord Swords having the incorrect hit visual effect. Their hits will now have the purple magic effect instead of the blue one.

Fixed a visual effect issue on the charged casting animation of Glintblade Hail.

Version 0.4.67

Added a new spell. Glintblade Hail creates a wave of glintblades and can be found outside Caria Manor, to the west.

Added a new talisman. The Prodigious Crown Pendant functions as an elemental Blue Dancer Charm and can be found in Lenne's Rise.

Re-added a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone to Mohgwyn. This one can be found behind Mohg.

Increased the speed of chained Carian Greatsword casts and charged chained Comet casts.

Fixed the missing text for the new Crystal Tears.

Decreased the amount of lightning Placidusax makes on co-op difficulties and lowered the brightness of the lightning visual effect.

Added more tutorialization to the Crucible Phantom.

Version 0.4.66

Large adjustments to the damage multipliers on specific attack types to make them more consistent between weapon types.

Increased the speed of multiple R2 attacks, mostly special multihit ones that were slower than others like the one on Eleonora's Poleblade.

Slightly decreased a few enemies resistance to death, making it more usable on specific enemies. Crabs, Albinaurics, Misbegotten, and Ancestral Followers are a few of these.

Fixed the Ruinous Ghostflame skills status buildup.

Fixed the Grafted Scion stagger-softlock (potentially for real this time).

Fixed the Godskin Noble's AI on the elevator by preventing it from moving backwards if it is too close to the edge of the platform. Also fixed some attacks that incorrectly triggered hard knockdown/launch animations.

Added the God mode custom difficulty.

Version 0.4.65

The Spinning Weapon skill now has blocking frames and will deflect projectiles. The Carian Regal Scepter's unique version of this skill has been renamed to Spinning Staff.

The Spiked Palisade Shield now deals Pierce type damage instead of Strike.

The God-Devouring Serpent's ground pull-up attack is now jumpable, though the timing is relatively tight. Decreased the strength of the Serpent-Hunter's jumping R2. Also greatly reduced the brightness of the lava under the Serpent/Rykard, making the fight much less eye-searing.

Modified the lighting in Farum Azula, mostly in the boss rooms of the Godskin Duo, Maliketh, and Dragonlord.

Nerfed the Elevator Godskin Noble's fatness by 10% and added it to the boss resurrection menu.

Version 0.4.64

Updated the poise values of multiple enemies that had too much poise for their HP. An extreme example of this in vanilla are the Erdtree Guardians, who have 55 poise despite having less than 150 base HP, compared to standard Soldier type enemies who have 30 poise and almost 200 base HP.

Improved the cancel windows on certain straight sword, curved sword, and greatsword powerstance animations, specifically the ducking and running attacks. Increased the stagger power of greatsword and hammer/axe/flail powerstance L1 attacks.

The Briars of Sin and Briars of Punishment spells now deal pierce damage instead of magic damage, making them more unique among other sorceries.

Made the Godskin Duo fight a bit easier with less staggering power on their fireballs and a slightly longer cooldown on the support fireball.

Fixed a bug that caused Waterfowl Dance to do less damage when the Hand of Malenia had a weapon buff. Fixed a bug that could cause Dynast's Finesse to recoil when buffed with additive physical attack power weapon buffs.

Fixed an issue where the 2H Charged R2s of the Treespear was dealing double the intended amount of poise damage.

Version 0.4.63

Added the following passive weapon effects:
    - Crystalian Weapons: Increase the damage of Crystalian sorceries slightly.
    - Nox Flowing Weapons: Drain enemy stamina on hit to recover your own.
    - Royal Greatsword: Added a small amount of Frostbite buildup, also increased the Frostbite buildup of the Wolf's Assault skill.

Added special Crystal Tear effects to the following Erdtree Avatars:
    - Liurnia South: Ruptured Crystal Tear
    - Liurnia North: Magic-shrouding Crystal Tear, Lightning-shrouding Crystal Tear, Holy-shrouding Crystal Tear
    - Consecrated Snowfield: Ruptured Crystal Tear, Thorny Cracked Tear
Also fixed an issue where the Liurnia South and Liurnia North Erdtree Avatars had swapped scaling levels. The South Avatar is now weaker than the North Avatar instead of the other way around.

Added a special weapon buff and visual change to the Caelid Divine Tower Godskin Apostle boss to give it something unique compared to the earlier Altus Plateau version.

Slightly increased the damage of Dragonfire, Glintstone Breath, Magma Breath, and Pest Threads.

Fixed an issue that prevented the Carian Knight's Sword and Lazuli Glintstone Sword from properly deflecting with released R2s.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Grafted Scion fight to softlock if the Grafted Scion was hit with certain attacks while stance-broken.

Fixed an issue that caused Death Flare to inflict way more self-status than intended.

Fixed an issue where some weapon buffs like Cragblade incorrectly applied the damage buff to sources of damage besides the weapon.

Version 0.4.62

Added the Arcane-knot Crystal Tear, found at the Rose Church.

Increased the speed of the first powerstanced L1 attack for daggers and the running/ducking attacks.

The Black Knife now gets a short destined death weapon buff after using the Blade of Death skill.

Increased the base poise damage of unarmed attacks from 1 to 2.5. Blackguard's Iron Mask now increases the damage unarmed attacks and increases the base poise damage from 2.5 to 4. For reference, fist weapons have a base poise damage of 4.5.

Added extra passive AI effects for the Redmane Castle Crucible Knight while the Misbegotten is still alive. These will not take effect in Co-op. Also fixed some issues with the Misbegotten's stagger levels that could give it some unintended true combos.

Increased the rune reward from Sanguine Noble and Leonine Misbegotten regular enemy variants.

Fixed an issue that caused certain Ashes of War to inflict way more self-status than intended. (Ice Spear, Hoarfrost Stomp, Chilling Mist, and Poison Mist)

Removed text references to "deadly/lethal poison" as this is no longer a mechanic in the game.

Version 0.4.61

Improved the cancel speed of most regular scythe and dagger attacks. Also improved the cancel speed of a few greataxe and axe attacks.

Decreased the cost of Discus of Light from 11000 to 6000 to account for how it is available much earlier.

Decreased the healing of the Crucible Phantom and increased the rune reward from 2000 to 4000.

Blacksmith Iji will now burn in Destined Death flames instead of Black Flame. His death animation now uses the weaker, pinker flame effect that the Black Knife Assassins use, not the deep red one used by Maliketh.

Greatly increased the lethality of the magic arrow storm on the Road to the Manor and added a visual cue to show exactly where the arrows are being fired from.

Version 0.4.6

Updated to game version 1.07.1.

Decreased the HP of Astel.

Version 0.4.59

Increased the effectiveness of using spells and melee attacks at the same time by allowing one handed melee attacks to be cancelled into spell casts more quickly. This change depends on the animation, some may have noticeable changes and some may not.

Slightly increased the speed that the player can attack out of throwing knife animations as well.

Increased the speed that the player can cancel the unique attacks of the Morning Star and multiple other random attacks.

Greatly increased the animation speed of the Cragblade Ash of War.

Increased the damage of powerstanced attacks by about 7%.

Updated the Fortune menu so that it is now divided into three options based on the Fortune rarity.

Added a new encounter mechanic with the Glintstone Dragon Smarag. If Smarag is awakened, it will take the Glintstone Academy Key. To obtain the Glintstone Academy Key without fighting Smarag, players must actually sneak around it.

Decreased the scaling level of the Bloodhound Knight Darriwil by one tier. Slightly decreased the healing of the Crucible Phantom.

Fixed an issue where giving the Great Club a Heavy affinity would lock it to the Heavy affinity.

Fixed the damage type of the Lucerne's charge attacks. They will now properly deal Strike damage.

Fixed missing text on the Whetblade Fragment menu. The Cursed affinity didn't mention that it added death buildup to weapons.

Potentially fixed an issue with fighting the Grafted Scion in the Eternal Return game mode.

Version 0.4.58

Added two new Crystal Tears. The Ceruleanspill Crystal Tear which raises max FP, and the Viridian Hidden Tear which briefly lowers stamina consumption. These tears can currently be found by defeating the Blighted Avatar in Deeproot Depths. Also increased the stat boost of the Spill type Crystal Tears by +5%.

Increased the availability of certain AoWs on weapon types. Ashes of War like Storm Stomp and Ground Slam can now be used on all armaments, and spell-type Ashes of War can now be used on the appropriate catalyst.

The Great Club weapon can now use affinites and ashes of war.

Added the initial hit to Gurranq's Beast Claw. Slightly decreased the spread of Crystal Burst and improved the casting animation.

Slightly decreased the enemy poise multiplier when using a Co-op difficulty.

Added a "day/night" cycle to Deeproot Depths, the area will now transition between the vanilla dark/brown during the day and the version 1.0 bright/gold at night. Also fixed some color issues with the water/waterfalls.

Fixed an issue where the extra damage proc of Magma weapons and Poison Moth Flight would be ignored if the enemy had i-frames. The only place this could really happen was a Magma weapon performing a critical attack on a Frostbitten target, so it wasn't common.

Fixed an issue where Melina could disappear and softlock your game if you rapidly sat up and down at sites of grace then tried to level up.

Lowered the difficulty of the Liurnia Godskin Noble on normal and lower difficulties by reducing the chances it does stronger attacks.

Added the version number to the title screen, thanks to ivi for making it so easy to add.

Version 0.4.57a

Slightly decreased the hitbox size of the Godskin Noble's fire pillars to make standing inside the circle of fire more consistent.

Increased the speed of the Broadsword rolling attacks.

Fixed an issue where there could potentially be two Godskin Nobles in the Divine Tower of Liurnia.

Fixed an issue where Blaidd's Spirit Ashes could appear before his death.

Fixed some issues with Melina. Melina now appears after the menu appears, and won't appear after she leaves in Leyndell until she comes back.

Version 0.4.57

Added the ability to move while casting Oracle Bubbles from the vanilla update.

Updated the Family Heads and Rosus' Axe weapons and weapon skills. Family Heads is now split Int/Fth scaling weapon like other death weapons (Bastard's Stars was already an Int flail anyway). Rosus' Axe is now a low requirement physical weapon, close to a Raw weapon, that increases vitality and drains the Death status when held. The Rosus' Summons unique skill has had its speed increased and now deals slash damage, and also has a 25% larger hitbox. The Tibia's Summons spell has also received the larger hitbox and slash damage as well, giving sorcery users a new damage type to use.

Increased the distance of the "Presence of Rot" and other status effect effects from 7 meters to 10 meters.

Fixed the delayed animation events on Ghiza's Wheel charged R2s.

Updated the Godskin Noble fight in the Divine Tower of Liurnia. This fight now awards the "Fortune of the Godslayers" as well as the original reward, the Godskin Noble armor set.

Restored the golden lighting to Deeproot Depths from Elden Ring version 1.0.

Removed the variance on Lichdragon Fortissax's lightning aura. It will now appear and explode on a set interval. This interval is now always the longest time that you could get in between explosions in vanilla, making it both less common and more consistent.

Melina will now appear at Sites of Grace when she is in your party.

Version 0.4.56

Updated for game version 1.07.

Cured Meat items no longer start with initial buildup after using the item.
    - Cured Meat: 60 second duration/125 resistance
    - White Cured Meat: 180 second duration/75 resistance
Increased the status resistance provided by the Mottled Necklace.

Updated the Roiling Magma spell to do small ticks of damage while its building to an explosion, this can stagger smaller enemies.

Updated Fire's Deadly Sin to now scale its damage based on Faith in the same way the Carian Retaliation spell does. The fire tick damage is buffed once at 30 faith and again at 60 faith. The initial cast damage still scales normally off of the spell boost.

Multiple other small buffs to spells like Shattering Crystal, Whirl, O Flame!, and some others,

Fixed an issue that caused certain Miranda Sprout enemies to instantly die to the Death status depending on their idle animation. These enemies had unused special effects in their animations and the ID ended up being used for the function of the Death status. This is a similar issue to the one that caused Vulgar Militiamen to hurt themselves when jumping, a special effect that doesn't exist in vanilla being attached to specific animations.

Version 0.4.55

Updated Ash of War descriptions to include the stat or stats the Ash of War scales with if it does not scale entirely with weapon damage. For example, the Prelate's Charge Ash of War now says "Ash of War Fire damage scales with Faith."

Fixed multiple Ashes of War that were missing animation speed increases despite sharing an animation with another Ash of War that had it's speed increased. This includes Chilling Mist, Poison Mist, Earthshaker, and Sacred Ring of Light. Also slightly increased the speed and poise damage of Storm Blade.

Updated the Death Ritual Spear so that it has the same scaling as Death's Poker and Helphen's Steeple. Also added a small amount of Frostbite buildup to the weapon. Increased the speed of the Spearcall Ritual animation and it now inflicts Frostbite as well. Also slightly increased the overall spread of the spears and the size of their hitboxes.

Buffed certain Giants' Flame incantations due to feedback. Specifically buffed the "Whirl, O Flame!", "Surge, O Flame!", and "O, Flame!" incantations in either damage, poise damage, and/or cast speed.

Added Gloveworts to the free early NG+ items.

Buffed the Fell affinity to make all status effects drain faster instead of just Rot/Frost/Madness/Death, making it more generally useful.

Changed the Spellsword Fortune so that the time you have to utilize the damage boost is longer, but the damage boost is harder to build.

Version 0.4.54

Added new "About Status Effects" and "About Jumping and Ducking" tutorial prompts to the Fringefolk Hero's Grave area.

Increased the early reinforcement effectiveness of a few affinities. This includes Cold, Cursed, and Soporific.

Buffed all 5 of the Crystal sorceries, including the two glintstone ones, in multiple minor ways from damage to FP cost. Slightly increased the damage of Flame of the Fell God and Rock Sling.

Increased the status resistance gained by the cured meat items from 100 resistance to 120. White ones were only boosted from 75 to 80 as they have double the duration of regular ones.

Removed the hidden 5x poise multiplier on the Night's Cavalry and Ancient Dragon enemies, making them actually poise-breakable.

Decreased the size of Commander Niall's lightning kick AoE even further from 6 meters to 5 meters. The original hitbox was a 7 meter long AoE.

Fixed a bug that lowered the Wizard Fortunes physical spell damage (mostly gravity spells) by 10%.

Version 0.4.53

Modified "AccumVal" effects in multiple ways. These are the effects like the Godskin Swaddling Cloth and Winged Sword Insignia that require hits to activate.
    - Increased the amount of health restored when using heavier weapons with the Barbarian fortune by increasing the level of effect heavier weapons have on their attacks.
    - Increased the effectiveness of the Rogue fortune poise damage boost when using fast hitting weapons.
    - Added the effect that activates these abilities to Guard Counter attacks.
    - Reduced the rate that the Winged Sword Insignia and similar buffs are lost over time.

Increased the damage and speed of the Spinning Wheel unique skill slightly. Increased the duration of the weapon buff added by the Cursed-Blood Slice unique skill.

Increased the damage and damage scaling of Ruin Fragments and most other thrown consumables like magic stones and throwing knives.

Increased the speed of all weapon buff animations.

Fixed the Scepter of the All-Knowing's weird hold position. It is now held like other staves.

Fixed an issue where the Perfect Deflect weapon glow overrode other weapon buff visual effects.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Gravitational and Blessed affinities to automatically be unlocked on new characters.

Version 0.4.52

Added split Int/Fth scaling to the magic damage of the Death's Poker and Helphen's Steeple weapons.
    - Increased the speed of the Ghostflame Ignition unique skill.
    - The Ruinous Ghostflame unique skill buff now increases the magic damage of the Helphen's Steeple by 50% and decreases its physical damage by 50%.

Added special Crystal Tear effects to the bosses that drop certain Crystal Tears.
    - Weeping Peninsula Avatar: Opaline and Crimsonburst related effects

Updated the lighting in Rykard's boss arena to better match the atmosphere and be less awful on the player and Rykard.

Added Elder Dragon Greyoll to the boss resurrection menu. Increased the attentiveness of Greyoll's children and gave them the ability to breath fire on harder/co-op difficulties. Removed 1 of the children, making it 6 dragons instead of 7. The requirement to kill 5 is unchanged.

Adjusted the poise values of multiple tough enemies to make them very slightly easier to stance-break.

Adjusted enemy health regeneration on harder difficulties so that it should be less powerful early-midgame.

Fixed NPC Randomization when using the Item and Enemy Randomizer.

Fixed an issue with the Crucible Phantom where it could enter phase 2 but not attack faster, making it potentially hard to kill as the faster attacks wouldn't happen to counter the health regeneration.

Version 0.4.51

Updated how weapon/shield status resistance works when blocking. Instead of being some hidden value, the amount of status resistance gained when blocking is now half of the corresponding damage type.
    - Physical - Blood/Poison/Rot
    - Magic - Frost
    - Fire - Madness
    - Lightning - Sleep
    - Holy - Blight
So now a shield with 100% resistance in a damage type will block 50% of that status. Affinities will continue to boost either an elemental resistance or a status resistance by up to 25%, so a Poison Shield will have 25% more poison resistance without 25% more physical resistance.

Updated light rolls so that players can attack out of the animation one frame earlier.

Added the "Blaidd the Half-Wolf" spirit ashes and fixed all of the issues with the Lazuli Sorcerer ashes. Blaidd's spirit ashes can be found at the top of Ranni's Rise after completing his quest.

Added the Bestial affinity effects and a Bestial incantation boosting effect to the Beastclaw Greathammer. Increased the speed of Regal Beastclaw.

Added actual Bloodflame to Mohgwyn's Sacred Spear when the unique skill is performed. Despite the description saying bloodflame, the weapon buff did not actually increase blood loss buildup at all, it only increased fire damage by 30.

Fixed the Ranni's Chambers Site of Grace.

Fixed the Warpick's incorrect Strike damage listing. Fixed issues with the scaling of elemental affinities on the Clayman's Harpoon and Treespear weapons.

Fixed an issue that could cause certain spells to deal 0 damage after a perfect deflect.

Added new title screen art, thanks to ivi for that and the new spirit ash icons.

Also since I forgot to credit him last time, thanks to Bruhballs for the Javelin of Gold spell and icon.

Version 0.4.5

Added a new spell, the Javelin of Gold incantation can be found from a miniboss in Liurnia added right infront of the Lift of Dectus.

Added a new Spirit Ash, the Lazuli Sorcerer Ashes can be found on the walls of Caria Manor.

Updated Marika's Hammer Gold Breaker skill with a more interesting visual effect, along with a larger and longer lasting hitbox. Marika's Hammer now also boosts the power of Golden Order incantations.

Increased the damage and poise damage of Ancient Dragon Lightning Strike to account for the lack of multiple hits. Also increased the cast speed of various other miscellaneous spells.

Restored the Rotten Ancestral Followers and Claymen to the Lake of Rot area instead of the Kindred of Rot.

Lowered the scaling of the Redmane Castle duo boss by one tier. This is about a 10% decrease to both health and attack power. This also matches other duo bosses which are one tier lower than the area they are in, the Redmane boss is a weird exception that didn't have this lowered scaling in vanilla.

Updated the Crucible Phantom to remove healing instead of lowering  the player's HP, allowing for a few more hits to be taken.

Increased the maximum distance certain enemies can move from their home position to help avoid situations where they teleport away mid fight.

Fixed the Grave Scythe Blood and Cold affinity passive effects. These were purely display issues, the stats were correct.

Fixed a bug that allowed players to rapidfire light bows while crouching.

Fixed an issue that caused Vulgar Militiamen to hurt themselves when jumping.

Fixed an issue that caused Sites of Grace to not restore all of the players HP in Full HP mode.

Fixed more issues with Magnus's text and finally fixed the text issue making the notification for upgrading flasks and talking to Melina not appear.

Version 0.4.49

Added the Fortune of the Spellsword for real this time (It was mistakenly purchasable early in the last update and didn't work). Thanks to lisolida for making the base of this fortune.

Changed the Fringefolk Hero's Grave to be immediately accessible from the Stranded Graveyard without a Stonesword Key. The scaling of the dungeon has also been lowered to match how it is more easily accessible.

A new boss has been added to replace the Ulcerated Tree Spirit in the Fringefolk Hero's Grave. The Crucible Phantom boss is a Crucible Knight with the unique gimmick that makes it impossible to damage regularly, instead players must avoid its attacks as it loses health over time. This boss acts as a sort of tutorial to the multiple ways to dodge attacks, with 4 attacks that each have to be dodged in a different way by either jumping, rolling, ducking, or simply moving out of the way. The Crucible Phantom can be resurrected at the Roundtable Hold.

Updated the Godskin Duo boss fight to work a bit differently than it did before. The health bar of the Duo has been separated into two healthbars, one for the Apostle and one for the Noble. Instead of draining a single combined healthbar, both the Apostle and Noble must be defeated at the same time. The Apostle and Noble will attempt to revive eachother when one dies, and they will respawn with half HP.

Added Drowsy AI to the Godskin Apostle and Noble that disables their stretchy attacks.

Increased the speed of the Carian Greatsword spell. Increased the damage of the Carian Piercer spell. Decreased the recovery time of the Angel's Wings skill and added a very small DoT to its hit effect.

Fixed an issue where the Regal Ancestor Spirit was healing more HP than intended.

Fixed some issues with certain NPCs who couldn't properly use their equipped gear.

Also added Frostbite to the Grave Scythe instead of Bleed. (Forgot to mention this.)

Version 0.4.48

Added a new Unique Skill to the Dragon Greatclaw. Dragon Bone Smasher is a unique skill with two parts, the description says:
"Press to swing the claw and launch a wave of lightning straight forward, imbuing the claw with its power.
Hold to perform a charged attack and release the stored lightning in a terrifying storm that rends even the flesh of dragons."

Increased the speed of the Beast's Roar, Double Slash, Thunderbolt, Shield Bash, and Shield Crash Ashes of War. Increased the damage and poise damage of Great Serpent Hunt (Great Serpent Hunt did the same poise damage as an R1 in vanilla).

Added the ability to use Gravitas on staves.

Fixed an issue where the Lucerne, Nightider Glaive, and Golden Halberd did not restore on FP on hit.

Changed the Erdtree Avatar in Deeproot Depths to a new Blighted Avatar variant.

Restored a Somber Smithing Stone [5] to Redmane Castle.

Further adjusted weapon affinity scaling.

Version 0.4.47

Improved the player's poise recovery timer from 30 seconds to recover after being hit to 12 seconds.

Adjusted multiple affinities like Heavy, Keen, Night, Fire, and others so that they are a bit more effective with weapons that they were doing poorly on, in a way that doesn't really affect weapons these affinities already worked well on.

Updated Gravity spells so that pure Gravity attacks deal Standard damage. This includes Gravity Well, Collapsing Stars, Gravitas, and Waves of Darkness. Gravity attacks with a mix of rocks and magic will still deal split physical/magic damage.

Updated the Ice Lightning Slash and Ice Lightning Sword weapon skills so that the frozen lightning bolt now scales off of the weapons own scaling stats instead of Intelligence and Faith. Also increased the frostbite buildup of the lightning bolt.

Increased the speed of the Eruption, Storm Assault, Vacuum Slicer, Storm Stomp, Hoarfrost Stomp, Corpse Wax Cutter, Death Flare, Ordovis's Vortex, and Siluria's Woe weapon skills.

Fixed a vanilla issue where Hoarfrost Stomp dealt 0 poise damage and wasn't considered a skill for the purpose of damage boosting effects like the Jar Shard talismans.

Increased the FP restored from hitting enemies with arrows and bolts.

Added a passive effect to the Godrick, Cuckoo, Redmane, Leyndell, and Haligtree Knight armor sets that slightly increase either poise, magic, fire, lightning, or holy attack power respectively.

Added the "Custom difficulties" menu. This menu contains difficulties with custom requested difficulty settings.

Added a Somber 9 to Castle Sol for a pre-Farum Azula Somber 9.

Version 0.4.46

Updated the "damage level" parameters for multiple player attacks. Damage level is a property of attacks that determines what knockback animation it triggers on enemies, like staggering them, knocking them back, or launching them upwards. Some enemies can only be staggered with a high enough damage level and will ignore attacks with low damage levels. The main changes to damage level include:
    - Increased damage level of R1 combo finishers.
    - Increased damage level of fully charged R2 attacks.
    - Increased damage level of some charged spells variants that didn't already increase damage level.
This is change has a large impact on combat against mobs and enemies that can be staggered without being stance-broken. Some enemies like the Bell Bearing Hunters have had their damage level resistances adjusted, allowing them to be very briefly staggered from powerful attacks despite being bosses. The intent of all these changes to stagger is to provide more meaningful choices when it comes to how attacks stagger enemies.

Reduced the stamina penalties of the Fortune of Latenna.

Added Frost to skeleton ghostflame attacks and Sleep to the Tibia Mariner's purple stuff. Also made the Tibia Mariner slightly harder by making it so that the presence of the Tibia Mariner doesn't contribute to the amount of enemies in combat, which caused all the skeletons to basically idle as observers instead of fighting.

Fixed an issue where Vyke's War Spear could trigger unintended special effects when attacking other players depending on it's upgrade level.

Fixed an issue where certain enemies lost their poison immunity, including certain Slugs, Loretta's phantom, and some other random enemies.

Fixed issues with Rain of Arrows when combined with certain arrow types.

Fixed Waves of Darkness (again).

Version 0.4.45

Updated the special arrow effects. Moved the extra effects of the Magicbone/Firebone/Lightningbone/Haligbone Arrows to the merchant arrows. Basically, the Dwelling Arrows, Fire Arrows, Lightning Arrows, and Golden Arrows now have auxillary effects that are listed in the description. These effects have also been added to bolts, specifically the Meteor Bolts, Flaming Bolts, Lightning Bolts, and Golden Bolts.

Lightning Arrows are a new arrow type, purchasable at the Altus Plateau merchant. Thanks to ivi for the item icon.

Added the Fortune of Latenna, obtained at the same time you receive Latenna's Spirit Ash. This is a Legendary bow-based fortune that allows players to charge arrows while holding the draw when using medium bows.

The Fortune of the Rogue poise damage buff now adds a small amount of flat poise damage to attacks, making it more powerful on faster hitting weapons like daggers.

Updated the Assassin's Cerulean Dagger talisman to restore 10% FP + 75 FP. This % restoration matches the restoration of the Assassin's Crimson Dagger.

Increased the animation speed of Oracle Bubbles and increased the poise damage and explosion size of Great Oracular Bubble.

Increased the potential damage specific enemy types can take from Poison and Rot from 1x-4x to 1x-5x damage. Basically, enemies will generally take a bit more damage from these statuses, but it depends on the enemy. For reference, 3x damage is about equal to vanilla DPS, so most weaker enemies like soldiers and imps get damaged more quickly from these statuses compared to vanilla.

Updated the status resistances of multiple low to mid tier enemies so that it is easier to proc status effects against them.

Improved the hitboxes of the Monstrous Dog and Monstrous Crow enemies.

Version 0.4.43

St. Trina's Torch now scales Sleep buildup off of Arcane. Increased the speed of the Firebreather and Fires of Slumber Ashes of War. Also increased the duration of the fire pools left by the AoWs.

Increased the speed of the Ordovis's Vortex and Siluria's Woe Ashes of War. Both of these weapons now slightly boost the power of Aspects of the Crucible incantations. Also fixed an issue where the Siluria's Woe projectile would not hit if the melee attack hit first.

Increased the speed of the Carian Greatsword and Carian Grandeur Ashes of War. Added Carian Grandeur to the Troll Knight's Sword.

Added an armor passive to the Tree Sentinel set the decreases the FP cost of area healing and support miracles slightly.

Changed the Carian Glintblade Staff to scale Sorceries off of both Dexterity and Magic. This change makes it a more unique staff that is the magic version of the Clawmark Seal.

Spell changes:
    - Increased the animation speed of the Briars of Sin
    - Bestial Vitality now restores a small amount of stamina over time as well as HP
    - Fixed an issue causing the Swarm of Flies spell to do over 3x the Blood Loss buildup it did in vanilla, it will still do more than vanilla, just not the ridiculous amount it was doing previously
    - Made it easier to hit all the damage ticks when using The Flame of Frenzy or Unendurable Frenzy, making it easier to hit max damage
    - Increased the damage and/or poise damage of multiple other spells and charged spells

Also the Rotten Crystal Staff now adds scarlet rot buildup to crystal sorceries. The amount applied increases with reinforcement. Thanks to El Fonz0 for figuring out that this was even possible.

Version 0.4.42

Added Smithing Stones to Catacombs/Cave/Tunnel boss drops. All of these bosses will now drop a Smithing Stone when defeated. Fallingstar Beasts will continue to drop x5 smithing stones and x1 somber smithing stone.

Increased the FP gained from Mind levels 1-40 by around 100. This means players will start with a bit more Mind and get a bit more per level until level 40.

Increased the Sorcery/Incantation scaling of staves at low levels of Intelligence/Faith. This means a ~7% damage buff at early levels for spell casters. This change and the Mind change will boost the power of spellcasters in the early game without adjusting their power at higher levels.

Spell changes:
    - Increased the projectile size of Catch Flame and O, Flame! so that they hit more consistently.
    - Increased the animation speed of Flame Sling and O, Flame!.
    - Improved the consistency of Flame Sling, Black Flame, and The Flame of Frenzy through higher tracking. Tracking is further increased while charged.
    - Increased the range of Honed Bolt.

Swapped Gurranq's rewards around when giving him Deathroot, so that Beast Claw is the 3rd reward and Bestial Vitality is the 4th. The Ash of War is now the 5th.

Increased the range of the Torchpole's emitted light.

Fixed an issue where the charged Night Comet spell didn't work.

Fast download link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WZiAo6tFWwuyrAbYg-CE3HImVP5epavO/view?usp=sharing

Version 0.4.41

Added a new Fortune, the Fortune of the Houses. This is an Intelligence and Faith based spell-casting Fortune obtainable from the boss at the Church of Vows.

Increased the damage of the following spells slightly:
    - Black Flame (10%)
    - Black Flame Ritual (12%)
    - Beast Claw (9%)
    - Stone of Gurranq (5%)

Fixed an issue that caused summoned spirit ash allies to ignore enemies and continuously walk into walls in certain areas.

Fixed an issue that caused only the base stat changes of Fortunes to work, meaning none of the more interesting effects were working. This was fixed already if you had the hotfix file.

Fixed an issue that caused the Rogue class to gain basically infinite stamina when wielding a heavy weapon.

Fast download link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MFq3M5rjXOQ0Sxqxfpsk06NsRaKIsPiH/view?usp=sharing

Version 0.4.4

Updated the weaponWeightRate system mentioned in the previous update to be applied more consistently to attack animations. This change required going over hundreds of player attack animations and took most of the time that it took for this update to come out. weaponWeightRate should now be more noticeable on weapons as it properly applies to most attack animations.

Multiple miscellaneous attack animations have also been made slightly faster with these changes.

Updated the range and accuracy of bows and crossbows. The Range stat will now properly affect the range and accuracy of arrows and bolts. Ranged weapons can now have either 25, 50, 75, or 100 Range. The Arrow's Reach talisman has also been buffed and will have more of an impact on projectile range. This will give bow users a wider variety of options depending on how much range they want.

Added the Rotten Armament spell to Gowry's shop. Added the Frenzybone Arrows, craftable with the Frenzied's Cookbook [1]. Added the Blightbone Arrows, craftable with the Missionary's Cookbook [7].

Enemies who die to Deathblight now drop 10% more runes.

Added the unused white seal glow VFX to the Godslayer's Seal. While the regular yellow seal glow is VFX ID 490000, this white one was 490010. I'm unsure if this glow was cut or if they just forgot to put it on the Godslayer's Seal.

Added the rest of the missing text to the Magnus invasion.

Adjusted the text box that appears after inserting a Stonesword Key so that it disappears more quickly when moving away from the statue.

Fixed arrow projectiles so that they now appear as fletched arrows with the feathers.

Fixed some issues with Banished Knight armor and helm alteration.

Fixed an issue that caused the Mists of Slumber weapon buff to disappear when taking damage.

Potentially fixed an issue that caused NPC enemies to have no I-frames when rolling.

Version 0.4.37

Added the weapon weight rate system. This allows weapons to attack slightly faster or slower depending on a unique weapon attribute called weaponWeightRate. It is not directly tied to weight, instead weapons have individually been given a value that makes them attack either slightly faster or slightly slower than other weapons in their class. For example, the Parrying Dagger is a slightly faster dagger and the Cinquedea is a slightly slower one.

Adjusted the Fortunes menu so that it will appear as long as you have purchased the Oracle Effigy, even if it is not in your inventory.

Difficulties now affect enemy teamAttack. This is a mechanic that controls how aggressive each enemy is in a group and is the thing that makes a lot of enemies in groups stand back and not attack. The main change here is that harder Co-op difficulties now decrease teamAttack, making groups of enemies more aggressive against more players.

Updated the Simple mode difficulty to be slightly easier, making it a bit more distinct from Normal mode.

Increased the damage of Whirl, O Flame and Flame, Fall Upon Them. Increased the damage of Lightning Spear and other Dragon Cult incantations slightly.

Fixed the Unarmed weapon. Despite displaying Strike damage, Unarmed attacks dealt Slash damage in vanilla. Unarmed attacks now deal Standard damage instead and properly display their damage type.

Fixed some issues with the "Magnus the Beast Claw" invasion. It will now properly count towards Varre's quest and Magnus is no longer missing his name.

Fixed an issue where either using the Lightning affinity or casting spells would both accidentally increase target priority.

Fixed the Shattershard Arrow (Fletched) drop in the Ainsel River area. That item now contains regular Shattershard Arrows.

Version 0.4.36

Updated for 1.06.

All unique arrows and bolts which were not infinitely purchasable from merchants now are. The Dwelling Arrows which were sold at the Mohgwyn Merchant are now sold at the Siofra River merchant.

Increased the speed of the Glinstone Pebble, Flame Sling, and Catch Flame cast animations. Fixed an issue where Great Glintstone Shard had a higher Intelligence requirement and less range than it should have. Slightly buffed the damage of some weaker spells like Crystal Burst/Barrage.

Rykard's Rancor should now tick damage more consistently, though will overall be less powerful and not do 10k damage in one cast.

Version 0.4.35

Fixed an issue where the host holding a weapon could cause other players to disconnect on load in Seamless Co-op.

Initial Fortune changes:
    - Rangers lose less Mind, and now lose a tiny bit of Faith and Strength. Increased the range boost from 25% to 35%.
    - Sorcerers will no longer lose the buffed tenth spell when using generators. Generators also no longer receive the damage buff.
    - Paladins now recover a tiny amount of FP when blocking, taking a direct hit still recovers the same amount as before.
    - Artificers now lose less Endurance and Mind.

Added missing text to the Oracle Effigy and Oracle's Remedy items.

Modified the casting requirements for Golden Order spells to require a bit less intelligence.

Version 0.4.34

Added the Fortune system. This is basically a class system, with classes that can be equipped at a bonfire. This updated includes 10 common fortunes. Common fortunes can be purchased at Sites of Grace using the Oracle's Remedy item, which can be found at merchant shops. Merchant Kale now sells the Oracle Effigy, which can be used to access this system. The goal of these classes is to provide unique benefits that fit certain playstyles, along with minor stat changes.

Added dynamic shadows to torches.

Added I-frames to player death animations. This will prevent the player from being afflicted by status effects like Deathblight after already dying.

Added frost buildup to the Family Heads weapon. Increased the animation speed of the Familial Rancor skill.

The Scepter of the All-Knowing has been converted into a spell catalyst, it can cost both sorceries and incantations.

Adjusted the stat requirements of the Dragon Bolt weapons like the Bolt of Granssax to better fit the faith scaling.

Flipped the Lucerne around, so it hits with the hammer and is now a strike damage Halberd. Thanks to Ronnie B. for flipping the model for me.

Enabled crafting of the unused Drawstring Freezing Grease.

Added an extra benefit to the Hammer talisman, it now slightly increases poise damage.

Modified the Old Lord's Talisman effect so that the duration increase now applies to most types of buffs, not only sorcery and incantation effects.

Stackable Poison and Rot from player sources should now be curable with standard Poison/Rot curing methods like boluses and resting at a Site of Grace. Sleep curing methods will also clear the Drowsy state now.

Greatly increased the fire rate of regular crossbows.

Some small spell changes:
    - Increased the cast speed and damage of Flame of Frenzy and Unendurable Frenzy.
    - Increased the range of Ambush Shard.
    - Decreased the FP cost of Glintstone Stars.
    - Increaed the damage of Glintstone Arc.
    - Increaed the damage of Magic Glintblade.
    - Increaed the damage of Fire Surge.
    - Increaed the damage of Flame Sling.

The Astrologer class now starts with Great Glintstone Shard, and the Prophet class now starts with Flame Sling. These spells are in addition to the spells these classes already had, and should give these classes some greater single target damage in the early game. Also swapped the position of the Academy Scroll and Royal House scroll so that the Shard spells are available early.

Removed the message that asks if you want to consume a flask to summon Torrent when using the whistle after Torrent dies. A flask is now used automatically.

Decreased the scaling level of Loretta in the Caria Manor and the Red Wolf in the Academy of Raya Lucaria by one tier.

Increased the aggression of the Fallen Cavalry in Normal mode.

Removed the Holy damage resistance on grafted enemies and Godrick. Grafted enemies are now weak to Holy damage, while Godrick is neutral.

Added missing character quotes and descriptions to the Eternal Return NPC graces.

Increased the range of summoning pools. Spirit Ashes should be usable in basically every area now.

Made all the missing (Altered) armor pieces now alterable through the tailoring tools.

Reverted difficulty flag changes that apparently caused difficulty to be reset when joining another player's world in Seamless Co-op (I'm still not sure why this happened).

Bernahl will now be selling an invitation to the Limgrave Colosseum. While this letter can be purchased and will open the Colosseum, the ability to do things in the Colosseum will be coming in a later update.


Version 0.4.30

Added the new "Game modes" menu accessible at the Chapel of Anticipation. The first game mode "Eternal Return" is a game mode focused on NPC quests. Cursed by the Three Fingers, you only have three (in-game) days to become Elden Lord before the flame consumes you and Order is lost forever. Players must empower themselves with Grace found from interacting with and completing NPC quests to become Elden Lord.

Game modes are probably not compatible with online play. Using a new save is recommended, as game modes may wildly change the game and can't be disabled after leaving the Chapel of Anticipation.

Increased two-handed attack damage by +5%.

Decreased the startup of jump animations. This has a minimal effect on gameplay, but it makes jumps feel so much better.

Adjusted the healing special effects of bosses to scale less with their maximum health. This applies to bosses like Malenia, the Regal Ancestor Spirit, and other bosses who have unique healing effects. Basically, the healing effects have been modified to use a combination of % based healing and a flat value instead of pure % based healing. This means as the bosses maximum health increases, whether that's due to co-op, difficulty settings, or NG+, the healing won't increase as much as it originally did. As an example, a heal of 2000 HP would now equal 3000 HP if the boss has x2 health, instead of 4000 HP.

Updated the Bloodhound Claws to be a Somber weapon, and the Bloodhound Step Ash of War is now exclusive to this weapon. This change accomplishes a few things. First, the Bloodhound Claws now uses the same reinforcement type the Bloodhound's Fang. This change also removes another scenario where there's simply an AoW that's the same as a previous one but better, and there is now a Somber claw type weapon. As well as all of that, the Night's Cavalry in Caelid will no longer be randomly dropping a Bloodhound Knight related Ash of War.

Because the Bloodhound Claws are now a somber weapon, they have received a special passive effect to synergize with the Bloodhound's Fang, lowering the FP cost of the Bloodhound's Finesse and Bloodhound's Step skill when used together.

Updated the Cleanrot Sword to also have this FP-cost-lowering passive effect when paired with either the Cleanrot Spear or the Halo Scythe.

Changed the name of the Cinquedea weapon skill to Beast's Step instead of Quickstep. Beast's Step has a powerful new effect that boosts the attack power of bestial incantations, detailed in the weapon description.

Fixed Bloodhound's Step/Quickstep/Beast's Step so that they actually circle around targets like the description says.

Changed the Cranial Vessel Candlestand's hold animation so that the fire isn't covering the camera.

Corhyn now sells the Discus of Light spell immediately.

Moved the corpse holding the Red-Hot Whetblade to be outside of the room it was originally in, making it accessible during the Radahn Festival.

Decreasesd the Fallingstar Beast's resistance to frost. Decreased the Ancestor Spirit's resistance to poison and rot.

Fixed an issue where crossbow reinforcement wouldn't count towards the unlock requirements for smithing stone crafting.

Fixed an issue that caused Vacuum Slicer and Corpse Wax Cutter to deal 0 damage when a weapon buff was applied to the weapon.

Fixed an issue that caused the Great Stars heal-on-hit effect to not work with certain affinities.

Fixed an issue that caused Alexander to fail to aggro onto Radahn from far away during the boss fight.

Fixed an issue that caused the Ancient Dragon Lansseax to not break trees and other objects upon collision with them.

Fixed an issue that caused the Resurrect Crucible Knight Ordovis button to mistakenly appear and resurrect the Impaler's Catacombs Erdtree Burial Watchdog instead.

Fixed an issue that caused other players in Seamless Co-op to be affected by the enemy stat increases applied from difficulty modes if friendly fire was enabled.

Changed the flag IDs used to track which difficulty is selected. All this means is that your difficulty will be reset to Normal mode upon loading your save after updating.

Version 0.4.29

Adjusted the damage values of every spell in the game with a focus on balancing for the new enemy defense values. This means a nerf to multi-hit spell attacks, as many were doing insane damage with the reduced defenses. There were also many spells with damage increases to better fit their FP cost, mostly single hit spells like Dragonmaw and Dragonclaw. Multiple spells also received consistency updates, so multi-hit spells are less all-or-nothing and not only viable against large targets. Overall, spell damage should be relatively accurate to the FP cost of the spell.

Fixed an issue with the Briars of Punishment spell where the thorn trail it left was missing a hitbox (Vanilla bug?). Fixed multiple other issues with the consistency of certain spells like Gelmir's Fury and the strange hitbox on Noble Presence.

Swapped the Noble Estoc's slash R2 attacks with the Cleanrot Knight Sword's thrusting R2 attacks to better fit with the design of the weapons.

The Thorned Whip and Hoslow's Petal Whip have been changed to Slash damage to better fit the design of the weapon.

Increased the speed of Flail heavy/charge attacks.

The Magma Whip Candlestick has received the same updates as the Magma Blade, scaling with intelligence and boosting the power of magma sorceries. Increased the speed of Sea of Magma. An issue where the Magma Blade didn't properly boost the power of magma sorceries has also been fixed.

Added a roll cancel window to the Eoachid's Dancing Blade skill like in vanilla.

Updated the Radiant Baldachin's Blessing to be weaker/shorter but infinite use.

Fixed an issue that caused the spear and shield soldiers in Fort Faroth to visually use the wrong weapon.

Version 0.4.28

Added a new site of Grace to Redmane Castle. The "Battlefield Approach" Site of Grace can be found right before the elevator leading to the Radahn fight.

Added a dynamic camera to the Godfrey and Hoarah Loux fight.

Updated enemy defenses and defense scaling. This is an overall reduction in enemy defense that should make split damage and light weapons a bit more viable against highly defensive targets, especially at early game levels.

Decreased the higher base enemy status resistance values from 400 -> 360 and 600 -> 500.

Increased flail damage by 5%.

Increased the speed of powerstanced daggers first L1 attack.

The Night affinity now slightly increases the critical damage of weapons.

The Spiked Spear now properly deals Strike damage on non-thrusting attacks instead of Standard damage, and this damage is now actually mentioned on the item's stat screen.

Added the Fire affinity passive to the Torchpole. The Torchpole's physical damage is now Strike damage instead of Pierce.

Converted the Spark Aromatic from Dexterity to Arcane scaling.

Version 0.4.27

Added a dynamic boss camera to the Malenia and Radagon bosses. This means that the camera in the fight will change depending on what Malenia is doing. Certain attacks will zoom the camera out, and change the position of it slightly to better frame the fight. Dynamic boss cameras will be added to other bosses as well, but it is something that needs to be made individually for each boss.

Added a new Site of Grace, on the floating rocks on the way to the Placidusax boss fight. This new Floating Temple Ruins Site of Grace will make getting back to the boss fight much less annoying.

Added Drowsy AI to Godfrey and Hoarah Loux.

Increased the status effect buildup of multiple status spells and consumables to match the increased buildup of weapons.

Increased the damage and range of the Fire's Deadly Sin. Greatly increased the speed of the Black Blade incantation and added a minimum amount of poise during certain parts of the cast animation.

Increased enemy base status resistance, and decreased enemy status resistance scaling after a status proc.

Improved the consistency of the guardbreak animation cancel. Enemy mult-hit attacks that hit before the guardbreak animation can be cancelled will no longer incur the guardbreak damage penalty.

Fixed an issue where the Omensmirk Mask and Sanctified Whetblade were sharing an acquisiton flag, causing only one to be obtainable at a time. If the Sanctified Whetblade was not obtained first, it is now obtainable.

Added a Miscellaneous tab to the Exchange shop, with purchasable Cookbooks. Added the missing Nox armor to the exchange shop.

Also fixed an issue that caused only one sword to be able to deal damage with the Starcallery Cry skill follow-up attack (Vanilla bug?).

Fixed an issue that caused Seamless Co-op's Tiny Great Pot item to clear the player's runes on use.
Version 0.4.25

Changed how time and death interact. This is a pretty big change to the aesthetic of boss fights. Dying no longer resets the time, it instead advances the current time by 3-4 hours. This means that you'll no longer be fighting every boss during the exact same time of day if you die once. This feature should work for multiplayer bosses as well, though anyone dying in the openworld and respawning may cause a slight time of day shift.

Updated smithing stone crafting. Smithing stones can now be crafted immediately after equipping a weapon of the maximum level of that stone. For example, equipping a +12 weapon will automatically unlock crafting for stones of +4 and below. You may need to toggle the weapon to register it being equipped if you were holding it while upgrading it.

Updated multiplayer enemy health regeneration to scale less with large enemy health pools. Also reduced enemy status resistance scaling in multiplayer.

Added Arcane scaling to weapons that inflict Poison/Blood Loss/Sleep/Madness that were missing it. This includes weapons with innate Blood Loss without an affinity that adds Arcane scaling.

Slightly increased powerstance status application by around 7%.

Fixed an issue where only the Hoslow's Set helmet was reducing Blood Loss damage.

Made it easier to hit max damage with The Flame of Frenzy and Unendurable Frenzy by reducing the damage tick rate but increasing the damage per hit, making the spells require less hits for full damage, also added slight tracking.

Updated some other spells in slight ways, like a slight increase to Glintstone Pebble's tracking and duration.

Fixed a vanilla text issue that incorrectly implied that Theodorix's Magma could be used while in the air.

Also fixed the scaling level of the Grafted Scion boss. The Grafted Scion will now use two separate scaling levels depending on when it is fought.

Version 0.4.22 Small Update

Updated multiplayer enemy health regeneration to scale less with large enemy health pools. Also reduced enemy status resistance scaling in multiplayer.

Added Arcane scaling to weapons that inflict Poison/Blood Loss/Sleep/Madness that were missing it. This includes weapons with innate Blood Loss without an affinity that adds Arcane scaling.

Slightly increased the effectiveness of the Blood and Poison affinites.

Fixed an issue where only the Hoslow's Set helmet was reducing Blood Loss damage.

Made it easier to hit max damage with The Flame of Frenzy and Unendurable Frenzy by reducing the damage tick rate but increasing the damage per hit, making the spells require less hits for full damage, also added slight tracking.

Updated some other spells in slight ways, like a slight increase to Glintstone Pebble's tracking and duration.

Version 0.4.22

Updated the Fort Faroth and Fort Haight areas.
    - Fort Faroth Area Scaling: 16 -> 9
    - Phantom Redmane Soldiers will now use the extended version of their "hanging" animation.
    - A bloody Redmane Knight is now in Fort Faroth, just like the knight in Fort Haight, and these knights now drop the Dectus Medallion pieces.

Updated the player's status effect resistance. Players will now start with a default resistance of 20% to Blood Loss, Frostbite, Madness, and Sleep damage. Also updated a bunch of bosses and enemies to have less full immunities to statuses.

Added the missing Crucible Tree Armor and White Reed's Set to the exchange shop. Also added more items to early NG+ like the Flask of Wondrous Physik.

Updated the Eleonora with the same effects as the Rivers of Blood. Also increased the speed of the Bloodblade Dance skill. The Rivers of Blood and Eleonora now have blood-colored weapon trails when using regular attacks.

Changed the color of the weapon trail of multiple other weapons to better match the weapon.
    - Magma Blade
    - Eochaid Blades
    - Mantis Blade
    - Godslayer Greatsword
    - Eclipse Shotel
    - Cipher Pata/Coded Sword
    - Clinging Bone
Also added small lifesteal on hit to the Clinging Bone and increased Arcane scaling.

Doubled the rune reward of the Cemetery Shade and Wormface bosses due to how deadly they can be.

Fixed an issue that caused bow weapon skills to consume arrows despite not spawning any when using a skill without FP. Increased Black Bow dexterity scaling

Version 0.4.21

Added a new Site of Grace to the Capital Outskirts area. The new "Inner Wall Lake" Site of Grace can be found near Blackguard Boggart's second location.

Updated hyper armor effects. Certain hyper armor effects like the ones used for spell hyper armor will no longer decrease your armor's poise by half before applying its minimum poise. Also added some hyperarmor frames to certain spells like Fortissax's Lightning Spear and Scarlet Aeonia.

Adjusted reinforcement values so that the Heavy/Keen and Night/Fire/Lightning/Blessed affinities are more effective at lower levels of reinforcement.

Increased the attack speed of light bows even further to make up for their reduced range.

Modified some early sorcery and incantation values based on feedback.

Increased the blood loss buildup of Varre's Bouquet.

Added fire particle effects to the Fire Prelate Helm and the Cranial Vessel Candlestick. Also updated the Candlestick with new passive effects and increased the speed of the Surge of Faith weapon skill.

Fixed an issue where blocking and using flasks could accidentally trigger AI projectile reactions.

Fixed an issue where Giant Hunt dealt the same poise damage as an R1 and only dealt thrust damage, even on weapons that don't deal thrust damage (Vanilla bugs).

Version 0.4.2

Added the Starlight Token mechanic. When going to NG+ early via the Altar of Anticipation the player will be given 10 Starlight Tokens. These can be exchanged at the Altar for any piece of gear in the game. NG+ cycles beyond the first will give 5 tokens.

Updated the default affinitises given by Ashes of War to better match the Ash of War. For example, Gravitas now gives the Gravitational affinity by default.

Updated bows so that light bows and regular bows have different ranges when firing non Ash of War arrows. Light bows have a very short range, regular bows shoot about twice as far. Short bows now also consume less stamina when firing non Ash of War arrows, and fire slightly faster. Also increased light and regular bow damage by around 8%.

Updated co-op poise scaling. Co-op poise scaling should be more effective on weaker enemies and less effective on tougher enemies, hopefully being more balanced overall.

Increased the rune gain multiplier of multiple areas by 5-25%.

Greatly increased the Regal Roar Ash of War speed. Also increased the roar hitbox size and the shockwave hitbox size. Regal Roar now also increases target priority like the other warcry abilities.

Roiling Magma's projectile will now bounce off of a target and lose momentum upon collision instead of just disappearing. Also slightly increased the damage and range of the explosion, and the duration of the magma pools.

Replaced the self damage of the blood Ash of Wars with self blood loss buildup.

Updated Cleanrot Knight hitboxes.

Also fixed an issue where Vyke's War Spear wasn't apply the buff to Frenzied Flame incantations.

Fixed an issue with the Dragonbreath incantations when used in the left hand.

Fixed an issue where perfect deflects sometimes wouldn't apply the visual effect and weapon buff.

Version 0.4.19

Weapon swapping and one/two-hand swapping animations can now be cancelled on the first possible frame.

Increased the window to repeatedly cast the Honed Bolt and Lightning Strike incantations. Fixed an issue where Ambush Shard would sometimes fire at a downwards angle and not travel the proper distance.

The following weapons now deal Standard damage
    - Maliketh's Black Blade
    - Gargoyle's Blackblade
    - Gargoyle's Black Blades
    - Gargoyles' Black Axe
    - Gargoyle's Black Halberd
    - Serpent-Hunter
Also added a weak Destined Death effect on hit to all of the Black Blade weapons.

The following areas have had scaling changes:
    - Leyndell, Royal Capital: 11 -> 13
This change puts Leyndell at a better level to transition into the next areas. The Subterrenean Shunning-Grounds is tier 14, and the Mountaintops of the Giants is tier 15, but in vanilla Leyndell was only tier 11, despite being right before both of those areas. This also fits with the progression from Deeproot Depths, with Deeproot Depths already being tier 12. The Draconic Tree Sentinel outside of Leyndell is also tier 12 by default, being harder than every enemy inside Leyndell normally. This change does not affect the difficulty of the Godfrey Phantom or Morgott boss fights, which are already tier 13 and 14 respectively.

Updated the Magma Wyrm animations and AI. The Magma Wyrm can no longer charge more than two times in a row, and charging has a slightly longer cooldown.

Fixed an issue that caused some of the elemental Whetblades to not spawn.

Fixed an issue that caused the Ranni's Rise site of grace to not work.

Version 0.4.18

Increased the status effect scaling weapons get from leveling Arcane (was 30% max, now 50% max).

The Lucerne weapon now deals pierce damage only instead of slash/pierce damage.

Increased the speed and duration of the Sacred Blade Ash of War. Increased the speed of the Repeating Thrusts Ash of War.

Prince of Death's Staff
    - Now uses mid-investment stat breakpoints instead of high-investment

Version 0.4.15

Increased the spell scaling stat at lower levels of intelligence or faith to make early game magic a bit more powerful. Also slightly increased the base damage of some lower cost spells by a small amount.

Increased the FP regeneration of Generator spells at low levels of Mind.

Increased the rune drops of most side bosses by around 25-50%. This includes dungeon bosses and overworld bosses.

Added the special Hybrid and Vanilla difficulty modes.
    - Hybrid mode is a single player mode that activates any Raid mode specific changes. It greatly increases the stats of both the player and enemies.
    - Vanilla mode makes multiple stat changes that puts many values closer to vanilla game levels, and is at the standard level of AI difficulty.

Added passive effects to the following armor sets:
    - Radahn's Set
    - Bull Goat's Set
And increased the effectiveness of the already existing Royal Remains set passive.

Slightly increased the duration of some fist attack hitboxes. Most noticeable on the Katar moveset.

Increased the speed of the Barrage weapon skill and lowered the FP cost.

Greatly increased the speed of the Flame Dance unique skill. Using Flame Dance will burn targets with DoT and give the Giant's Red Braid a fire effect. Also added passive effects to the Giant's Red Braid.

Version 0.4.14 Small Update

Small update to help with some important balancing issues.

Slightly increased the spell scaling stat at lower levels of intelligence or faith to make early game magic more powerful.

Slightly increased the base damage of some low-mid cost spells by a small amount.

Slightly increased the FP regeneration of Generator spells at low levels of Mind.

Increased the rune drops of most side bosses by around 25-50%. This includes dungeon bosses and overworld bosses.

Version 0.4.14

Turned 6 spells into "Generator" spells. Generator spells are fast spells that do decreased damage but will generate FP on hit and do not take any spell slots to equip. The 6 generator spells are:

    - Glintstone Pebble
    - Carian Slicer
    - Ambush Shard

    - Honed Bolt
    - Catch Flame
    - Bestial Sling

These spells function as options for mages to actively generate FP without having to use Flasks. Leveling Mind and increasing your maximum FP will increase the FP you generate.

Decreased the effectiveness of Cerulean Flasks.

Added multiple new effects to Loretta's War Sickle. Exclusively on the War Sickle, Loretta's Slash has been renamed to Loretta's Enchanted Slash. Loretta's Enchanted Slash buffs the blade with magic damage. This magic buff also boosts cast speed by 125 points and increases the magic damage of spells by 10%.

Lowered the stamina consumption of the Hand of Malenia. Added the ability to use affinities on the Treespear. Increased the speed of the Slumbering Mists skill.

Improved the Fire Monk enemies hitboxes.

Added more bosses to the boss resurrection menu, including the Fire Giant, Mimic Tear, Soldier of Godrick, and others.

Version 0.4.12

Added one extra spell slot to characters at the start of the game for a maximum of 14. This is the maximum number of spell slots the game supports.

Adjusted the stamina and spell slot costs of most spells to better match their FP values. This means, in general, that there are low stamina costs for low FP spells and high stamina costs for high FP spells. Spell slot costs have been adjusted in similar manner, with spells on the low end taking 1 slot and the high end taking 3.

Increased the spell scaling of all staves and seals by around 10%. Some less powerful catalysts received a bigger buff, while some stronger ones received less of a buff. The maximum possible spell buff on the strongest catalysts is still 430.

Added passive effects to the following armor sets:
    - Royal Knight Set
    - Beast Champion Set
    - Twinned Set

Turned the Dragon King's Cragblade and Bolt of Gransax into Bolt affinity weapons.

Updated the hitboxes and animations of the Ancient Dragons/Lichdragon.

Fixed a bug where Mohg would say "duo" twice.

Version 0.4.1

Added the ability to advance to the next Journey early at the Chapel of Anticipation. Interact with the statue in the starting room to begin your next Journey early. Using this feature will provide you with runes and materials to upgrade yourself to the appropriate level. The purpose of this feature is to provide an experience that doesn't require you to worry about upgrade materials or leveling that much. When playing with NG+ scaling, any area can be done in any order. This mechanic is not available after killing the Grafted Scion or leaving the Chapel of Anticipation for the first time.

Adjusted the scaling levels of these areas.
Areas scale from level 1 to level 21, 1 being the level of the Soldier of Godrick and 21 being the level of Malenia, Blade of Miquella.
    - Weeping Peninsula Bosses: 5 -> 4
    - Stormveil Castle Enemies: 4 -> 5
This change smoothes out the difficulty, with certain parts of Weeping Peninsula being easier, and the regular Stormveil Castle enemies now being on the same level as the boss, Godrick.
    - Siofra River Enemies: 7 -> 6
    - Ainsel River Enemies: 6 -> 8
These changes mean that Siofra River and Ainsel River are more suitable to the levels players would normally get to them at. Having Siofra River be such a high level and Ainsel River be lower leveled than the Liurnia Overworld didn't make much sense. All of these scaling changes also change the soul rewards of the enemies in the areas.

Decreased the stamina damage of certain enemy AoE attacks like the AoE damage on Margit's staff slam attacks. Increased the stamina damage on enemy thrust attacks, thrust attacks will specifically do more stamina damage than other attacks.

Also added a head lock-on point to the Ancestor Spirits.

Added extra cooldowns to Godrick's whirlwind attack to help avoid situations where he would spam it multiple times in a row.

Lowered the scaling of Commander Niall's summons. Improved Nialls attack tracking on certain attacks that whiffed too often and restored a cut basic attack.

Version 0.4.06

Aromatic updates. Multiplied all perfume bottle sources by x3, and all crafted perfumes will be crafted 3 at a time. Increased the speed of all perfume bottle use animations, and modified the special effects to better suit the triple bottle limit. The Uplifting Aromatic now heals and buffs the user and allies, but the buffs are tied to the shield it gives. The Spark Aromatic now fires in a different formation depending on if it is used from up close or far away.

Updated the damage negation values of multiple enemies to be balanced around the Standard damage x1 damage multiplier being the default amount of damage. More enemies will take more consistent damage, and damage types are overall better balanced between the 3 common physical types.

Fixed a big where certain weapons that were previously unbuffable in Vanilla lost damage on specific special attacks if they were buffed.

Ambush Shard is now classified as an invisibility sorcery for the Staff of Loss damage bonus. Ancient Death Rancor now has a bit more tracking. Reduced the self frost buildup of Adula's Moonblade.

Increased the speed of the Ice Lightning Sword unique skill.

Version 0.4.04

Updated the player's version of the Death status. To kill a target with Death, you simply need to activate it while a target is already under the effects of Death's curse flames. Depending on the enemy this can take 2 to 3 activations of Death, and it may be basically impossible on tough enemies like bosses.

Added innate Sleep buildup to the Harp Bow.

Added passive armor effects to the Fire Monk and Godskin Monk armor sets.

Swapped the icons of Briars of Sin and Briars of Punishment, as the icons fit better reversed.

Adjusted the bullet properties of more spells like the Frozen Lightning Spear and Pest Threads.

Reduced the guardbreak damage penalty by 5% on Normal difficulties and 10% on Easy difficulties.

Improved the hitboxes of the Scaly Misbegotten and the Claymen.

Slightly reduced the HP of certain bosses with a bit too much base health like the basic Dragons and the Ancestor Spirits. Decreased the strength of the Imps in the Erdtree Burial Watchdog fight and the Skeletons in the Cemetery Shade fight.

Fixed multiple bugs with things like healing Torrent, Haligbone Arrows, Great Stars, and other stuff. Fixed the Commander's Standard for real this time.

Version 0.4.02

Fixed some issues that caused attacks to stop registering in Seamless Co-op.

Added a PvP difficulty mode that reduces the effectiveness of status effects, reduces the effectiveness of flasks, and overall decreases damage in PvP.

Increased the damage received when guardbroken, and added the ability to roll out of the guardbreak animation.

Slightly lowered FP regeneration and the maximum amount of total FP.

Flame, Grant Me Strength now stacks with other body buffs, though it has reduced effectiveness.

Fixed an issue where Decaying Ekzykes had the wrong visual effect on one of its breath attacks.

Fixed an issue where the Dragonkin Soldier of Nokstella could be kept from entering phase 2 by staying behind it (Vanilla bug).

Version 0.4.01

Small update for some important fixes related to text, multiplayer scaling, and FP.

Version 0.4.0

Added a new way to regenerate FP for spell users. Simply casting any spell will trigger a period of heightened FP regeneration. This is a % value, so the more maximum FP you have, the more you will generate. With enough max FP, low cost spells can be refunded entirely or even give back more FP than they initially cost.

Ducks can now instantly be cancelled into spell casts.

Adjusted the properties of the Standard damage type. Standard damage will now deal neutral 1x damage to every single enemy. All critical attacks now deal Standard damage, and most weapons that were Standard before are now Slash. Morgott's Cursed Sword is a new Standard weapon, as the cursed blade cuts through everything equally. Unseen Blade converts weapon damage into Standard for its duration, making it potentially very useful if facing an enemy that heavily resists your weapons damage type.

Changed the damage type of most of the player's gear to better match what the damage type actually should be. For example, Pest Threads now deals Pierce damage, Stone of Gurranq now deals Strike damage, and Beast Claw now deals Slash damage. Most player gear that had an improper physical damage type, like the Forked Hatchet and it's lack of Pierce damage, should be fixed.

Lowered the multiplayer scaling tier of the Night's Cavalry horse and reduced the base HP of the Night's Cavalry slightly. Slightly lowered the base HP of the Valiant Gargoyles.

Fixed an issue where Rallying Standard and Poison Armament wouldn't work in certain situations. Fixed an issue where the multiple lightning strikes from the Frozen Lightning Spear spell wouldn't deal any damage (Vanilla bug?).

Also fixed an issue in the "Regular difficulties" menu where pressing the back button would incorrectly act as if you pressed the "Enable Normal mode" button due to both of those inputs sharing the same ID.

And fixed an issue where certain upgrade levels could cause weapons that apply special effects with their weapon skills to apply incorrect effects like that of the Finger Severer. This was most noticeable on the +3 Carian Knight's Sword, and on weapons with the Golden Vow Skill.

Version 0.3.97

Added an extra sub-menu for difficulty selection.

Increased the animation speed of multiple spell cast animations, including some of the dragon lightning ones.

Increased the duration of the cast speed boost provided by Rejection and Thopp's Barrier. The cast speed boost now provides 125 cast speed for 7 seconds.

Added passive effects to the following armor sets:
    - Fingerprint Set
    - Hoslow's Set / Diallos's Mask
    - Malformed Dragon Set
    - Night's Cavalry Set
    - Maliketh's Set
    - Raging Wolf Set

Reduced the effectiveness of the Dragoncrest Shield Talismans, but also reduced the damage boost enemies gain on harder difficulties.

Increased the runes dropped by the harder Runebear variants, so they now drop more base runes than the basic ones.

Slightly nerfed Royal Knight Loretta's HP by 10%, and made some of her Hard mode exclusive projectiles easier to dodge by a couple of frames. These changes do not affect Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree.

Fixed an issue where Starscourge Radahn spawned more gravity orbs than intended on Hard/Master mode. He was incorrectly spawning orbs that should only spawn on Raid mode. Lowered Radahn's scaling level by 1 (Tier 13 to Tier 12).

Gave Godfrey a very rude addition to one of his attacks on Raid mode.

Nerfed Glintstone Icecrag.

Version 0.3.96

Decreased the scaling level of the Death Bird, Erdtree Avatar, and Omenkiller in South Liurnia to better match the scaling of the area. All three of these bosses were, for some reason, set to the same scaling level as Rennala in vanilla, despite appearing way before the Academy. This should help smooth out the difficulty spike that could happen when getting to these bosses on harder difficulties or while during co-op.

Modified the stats of some of the giant Troll and Golem enemies. Regular Trolls and Golems should now be less of a pain to fight with less HP.

Adjusted the rune values of multiple enemies. Overall there should be slightly more runes dropping from most enemies. Certain minibosses like the Grave Warden Duelist will also drop extra runes.

Added some new armor passives. This is the beginning of an effort to add a unique passive effect to every set of armor in the game. Armor passive effects can be found in the item description. This patch adds effects to the following armor sets:
    - Lord of Blood's Robe
    - Cleanrot Set
    - Kaiden Set
    - Nomadic Merchant's Set
    - All-Knowing Set

Modified the FP to damage ratio of some of the weaker spells and incantations like Catch Flame.

Added target priority modifiers to the Warcry and Unseen Form ability effects. Target priority has also been adjusted for some animations. For example, during the Warcry and other roar animations, target priority is increased greatly even without the buff.

Increased the speed of the Night and Flame Stance weapon skill attacks.

Increased the rarity of somber smithing stones by converting many of them into regular smithing stones.

Fixed the messed up button icons and the missing Return to Desktop text.

Version 0.3.95

Updated to Elden Ring Calibrations Ver. 1.05.

Increased the size of dagger hitboxes by 20-30%. Improved the consistency of powerstanced dagger rolling and ducking attacks. Reduced the hitstop time of powerstanced dagger attacks with 3 hits to match the total hitstop time of 2 hit attacks.

The Meteorite Staff can now be upgraded, using Somber Smithing Stones.

Fixed an issue where only the Frenzied Flame Seal could do damage with Inescapable Frenzy. The Frenzied Flame Seal will still do extra damage with the incantation compared to other seals.

Fixed an issue where only the (Altered) variant of the Gravekeeper Cloak would increase aggro (Vanilla bug).

Added small arm hitboxes to Tree Sentinel and Godfrey to help avoid situations where their attack hitboxes inconsistently whiff when up close despite looking like they should have hit.

Sped up multiple attacks of Godrick the Grafted to make the fight less slow and awkward. Improved the accuracy of some of Godrick's attacks.

Version 0.3.94

Adjusted the behavior of counter frames. Instead of boosting only pierce damage by 30%, counter frames now boost pierce damage by 20% and all other damage types by 10%. Additionally, enemies now take 10% more poise damage during counter frames.

Modified the Spirit Ash ban in harder difficulties so that it no longer interferes with the FP cost of consumables that use FP like certain Aromatics. Using a Spirit Ash in a difficulty where it is banned will now instantly activate the Memory of Grace, returning the player to their last used bonfire and dropping their runes.

Fixed an issue where Inescapable Frenzy was using the right hand weapon for damage calculations. Inescapable Frenzy will now only trigger grabs when held in the left hand. Succesfully grabbing a target will now slightly reduce your Madness buildup. This spell is most effective with the Frenzied Flame Seal.

Improved the Miquella's Rings of Light and Sacred Phalanx weapon skills by increasing the animation speed and improving the projectile properties of both.

Fixed an issue where Frozen Armament required double the intended amount of FP.

Fixed an issue where the Blood affinity Scavenger's Curved Sword had around 30% more status buildup than intended.

Added a head lock-on point to the Fallingstar Beast, added some more ground spikes when playing in Co-op mode, and adjusted some other attacks.

Version 0.3.93

Added new loading screen tips and modified some existing ones to be more accurate.

Slightly increased the amount of stamina gained at early levels of endurance.

Improved the cancel windows of the Starscourge Greatsword paired attacks to match the improvements other weapons received. Added a Cragblade weapon buff to the Starcaller's Cry weapon skill. Cragblade now turns the weapon's physical damage into Strike damage.

Added the ability to Deflect with the Carian Knight's Sword by letting go of R2 while charging a heavy attack.

Added Intelligence scaling to the Golden Order Greatsword's Holy damage.

Increased the amount of deathblight buildup on the Mantis Blade. Fixed the Mantis Blade listing the wrong effect and affinities not having the deathblight effect listed (Visual bugs).

Slightly sped up the animations of powerstanced katana attacks.

Fixed issues with the Horn Bow. The Horn Bow can no longer use affinities for now, but can use Ashes of War.

Slightly decreased the speed of some of the Ancient Hero of Zamor's ice attacks.


Version 0.3.92

Added FP regeneration to arrows. More powerful arrows/bolts will generally restore more FP. For example, Stormwing Arrows, Haligbone Arrows, and Comet Magicbone Arrows will restore the most FP out of all regular arrows.

Increased the amount of arrow/bolts created per craft. The amount created now varies by type. Bone arrows have the most created per craft at 50, while Stormwing have the least at 10.

Modified the abilities of some Physik Tears. Important changes in the changelog.

Fixed an issue causing Frozen Armament to not trigger any Frostbite buildup.

Fixed an issue where the Magma Wyrm could charge more times in a row than intended. Fixed an issue that broke Rennala's ability to summon any phantoms.

Version 0.3.91

Added the fast Duck cancelling mechanic to L1 attacks.

Added a second, more expensive Whetblade Fragment to Kale's shop.

Updated the AI of the Crucible Knight Duo. The Crucible Knights will co-ordinate together a bit more, and on harder difficulties will become more aggressive. Also updated the AI and bullets of Dragonlord Placidusax for Raid mode.

Improved the hitboxes of the Cemetery Shades. Added Deathblight buildup to their attacks instead of Bleed. Deathblight has also been added to their weapon, the Mantis Blade.

Fixed Blood Grease and the Seppuku buff having an unintentionally short duration.

Fixed an issue where the Greatshield Talisman did literally nothing (Vanilla bug?). Fixed an issue where Barricade Shield and other shield buffs could not increase shield Guard Boost. Fixed a bug where the player would take no damage when getting hit mid-deflect.

Fixed the missing FP regeneration on the Starscourge Greatsword paired attacks and increased the animation speed of Starcaller Cry.

Version 0.3.9

Adjusted Co-op balancing based on feedback and personal playtesting. Renamed and rebalanced the individual Co-op difficulties slightly. Each difficulty now has a recommended player count.

The Smithing Table can now upgrade weapons to +25. This should help co-op players avoid the need to travel to the Roundtable Hold.

Inescapable Frenzy now works on regular enemies, using the animation of Lifesteal Fist.

Ducks can now be immediately cancelled into R1 attacks.

Applying poison now lowers an enemies poison resistance even further, for greater poison stacking.

Carian Grandeur is now a unique Ash of War exclusive to the Carian Knight's Sword. As it is now exclusive to this weapon, Carian Grandeur gets the new effect of spawning a Terra Magicus sigil on full-charge. Carian Greatsword is still usable on normal weapons.

Added some AI checks so the Godskin Noble is less likely to instantly cancel its roll attack into another animation (Vanilla bug).

Adjusted the scaling of weapon status effects so that they are more easily adjustable on an individual weapon basis. This change may have resulted in some weapons losing/gaining more status buildup than intended, but now weapon status buildup can be tuned individually, so feedback on the status buildup of weapons would be appreciated.

Version 0.3.89

Removed the 20% extra damage taken while the player is guardbroken (Vanilla mechanic).

Rainbow Stone Arrows now deal strike damage instead of pierce and have increased base damage.

Increased the speed of the Darkmoon Greatsword weapon skill and charged attacks.

Fixed an issue that broke Rennala's AI.

Version 0.3.88

Fixed some issues with bow affinities, more bow affinities should work properly now at lower levels, including the Occult affinity.

Updated the flask sharing effect to work with other players while in the Seamless Co-op "neutral" mode.

Fixed an issue where guard counters would sometimes turn into regular R2 attacks when blocking attacks in quick succession.

Replaced the deprecated Fletched Shattershard and Rainbow Stone Arrow drops in the Ainsel River and Leyndell Sewer areas with their regular versions. Fixed the Magicbone Arrow fletched icon not having the magic aura (Vanilla bug).

Version 0.3.87

Updates to the enemy health regeneration values in Co-op to make dealing with that a bit easier.

Increased the drop rate of all crafting materials from enemies. Increased the amount of beast bones and flight pinions that can be dropped at once (1-2-3 to 1-3-5).

The Leonine Misbegotten at Castle Morne now wields the Grafted Blade Greatsword that it drops. This means larger hitboxes, and the Leonine Misbegotten can now use the Oath of Vengeance skill.

Added a new buff effect to the Destined Death weapon skill. When the weapon buff is active, Maliketh's Black Blade shoots projectiles on heavy attacks. Charged heavy attacks shoot projectiles that travel further and deal more damage.

The Queen's Black Flame weapon skill now applies a Black Flame Blade buff to the Godslayer Greatsword.

Version 0.3.86

Removed the hitbox from players during their looping death animation. Dead players should no longer have collision and be targeted by enemies in Co-op.

Added Bow affinities. There is currently a bug where Bow affinity on-hit affects, such as extra madness build-up or lingering burn damage, may not properly change when swapping affinities. Whenever swapping Bow affinities, it is recommended to cause a loading screen by warping, dying, or quitting to the title screen to properly update to the selected affinity's correct effect. Certain on-hit effects such as the Bestial infusion effect would not function on bows and so are not listed.

Version 0.3.85

Adjusted Co-op difficulty scaling, and added a "Co-op Normal" mode that should be used as the default for Co-op playthroughs when not using a "Co-op Hard" mode. As the "Co-op Normal" mode provides the intended default difficulty for Co-op, using Co-op without selecting a difficulty will now be a bit easier than before.

Modified healing incantations so that the healing applied to allies is equal to the healing applied to the caster. This results in a nerf to self-healing, but a buff to ally-healing.

Made modifications to the Commander's Standard weapon skill, Rallying Standard, to make it more effective when combined with co-op and other buffs.

Reduced the frequency of the Red Wolf's dodges in response to projectiles when in Co-op.

Added status effect scaling based on Arcane to sorcery and incantation catalysts. Just like weapons, this arcane scaling to status buildup only applies to Poison, Bleed, Sleep, and Madness. Increased the effect of Arcane scaling on weapons status buildup.

Added Bestial affinity effects to the Cinquedea. Added the Magic affinity effects to the Crystal Knife, Crystal Sword, and Crystal Spear.

Version 0.3.84

Increased the target priority of low health players. Enemies should choose to target low health players more often.

Added damage scaling to Poison and Rot based on the enemy it is applied to. Certain enemies will now take more damage from these status effects. In general, lower tier enemies will take higher damage from these status effects, making them more useful on enemies with smaller healthbars.

Adjusted the lower levels of reinforcement on elemental affinities to be closer to vanilla values.

Fixed the Bandit class starting with the deprecated fletched arrows. They now start with 60 regular bone arrows. Increased the Samurai arrow count to 40 arrows.

Improved the consistency of guard counters (maybe).

Certain buffs (Golden Vow and others) now gain increased duration when applied to allies. Slightly increased the range of buff incantations so affecting allies is more consistent.

Sped up the Spinning Slash skill (Halberd/Dragon Halberd variants) and the Catch Flame incantation.

Mohg has received some Co-op Hard mode changes. Mohg Raid Boss.

Version 0.3.83

More balance adjustments to co-op scaling and co-op hard mode. Co-op hard mode should be more difficult, especially with 3-4 players.

Improved the consistency of flask sharing.

Added passive affinity effects to certain Somber weapons that should have them. This includes the Gravitational effects on the Starscourge Greatsword, the Cursed effects on the Eclipse Shotel, the Rotten effects on the Hand of Malenia, and more.

Morgott's Cursed Sword has gotten the Occult affinity effects and the weapon skill has been sped up by quite a bit.

Added [Active] text to the currently active difficulty.

Version 0.3.82

Balanced co-op scaling more, based on testing exactly how co-op scaling works and is applied to enemies. Co-op scaling will now properly affect bosses like Godrick the Grafted and any other enemies it didn't work on before.

Increased the range and effectiveness of flask sharing.

Increased the status build-up of most non-scaling status afflicters. This includes spells and consumables.

Moon of Nokstella now slightly increases passive FP regeneration.

Version 0.3.81 Hotfix 1

Download this file after downloading Version 0.3.81

Increased the size of the flask share hitbox. Adjusted some multiplayer hard mode stats to be more fair.

When using difficulty modes in co-op, make sure every player has the same difficulty selected, or it will mess with enemy stata and make them way more powerful than intended.

Version 0.3.81

Added Co-op Hard modes. In these modes, all players will need to work together to overcome very powerful enemies.

Added flask sharing. Using a flask in range of an ally will replenish their HP/FP by half of the amount from the flask.

Holy Ground now applies a poise damage buff.

Lightningbone Arrows now have an extra spark when used on water. Fixed an issue where Magma Wyrms would not enter their standing state for longer than intended due to the timer sometimes being reset.

Version 0.3.8

Improved the consistency of follow-up attacks after blocking/deflecting. R1 attacks can now be done instantly after blocking/deflecting, just like R2 attacks.

Improved the bow Ash of War skills, and bow Ash of Wars will now properly scale depending on the arrow used. Removed the ability to use bow Ash of Wars with no FP.

Enemies will gain more resistance to status effects after being afflicted by one. Bleed gains the most resistance per activation, and Poison gains the least. Increased the base status affliction of weapons and spells to make getting the first status activation off easier, but now the subsequent ones may be harder. Adjusted the values of Poison and Rot status effects so they are more useful.

Adjusted the Helphen's Steeple weapon and Ruinous Ghostflame weapon art in speed, damage, and moveset.

Updated/fixed the incredibly high damage negation of the Bell-Bearing Hunter/Elemer of the Briar. Also updated the resistances of many other enemies.
See the boss resistance spreadsheet for ERR here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wdpjMX9VsgjpdT1QisTf1YrUHV9O9N8QdlNHpBZ66NU/edit?usp=sharing

Improved the hitboxes and camera of the giant Wormfaces, and also reduced the duration of the lingering curse clouds. Improved the hitboxes of the Chariots in the Hero's Grave dungeons.

Version 0.3.79

An update.

Updated certain bow and arrow mechanics. Includes modifications to the abilities of certain arrow types and the carrying capacity of arrows. This is only an initial update to arrows, further updates to different arrows and other types of projectiles like bolts will come in the future.

The Poison and Rot statuses can now stack against enemies, meaning it can be applied again even while it is active. Scarlet Rot now lowers enemy defense while active, remember that defense is different from damage absorption.

Increased the amount of status buildup dealt by most weapons, with poison and sleep gaining the largest increase. Enemies now become even more resistant to status effects after being afflicted by them multiple times.

Reduced the distance the Red Wolf moves after certain attacks.

Fixed an issue with Blessed weapons doing more damage than intended when under weapon level 25.

Version 0.3.77

A moderately sized update.

Fixed an issue where the Whetblade Fragment and the Golden Tailoring Tools shared the same getItemFlag, resulting in the acquisition of one disabling the acquisition of the other. Both items will now properly work independently of eachother.

Improved the cancel windows of R1/L1 attacks on multiple different weapon types. Improved the cancel windows of rolling attacks as well. Increased the animation speed of multiple spells.

Added a passive to Magma affinities that synergizes with Frost and Magma sorceries. Added text for all weapon affinity passive effects.

Slightly increased the damage of powerstanced attacks (10% buff). Fixed an issue with certain multi-hit attacks restoring way more FP than intended.

Added Ancient Dragon Smithing stones and Gloveworts to the Fingermaiden shop permanently, after defeating Radagon.

Improved hitboxes of the Abductor Virgins. The duo fight should feel much better

Increased the accuracy of some of Margit's attacks that had a tendency to miss with the improved hitboxes. Fixed the issue with the two Godskin Apostle attacks that were incorrectly flagged to go through blocking. Fixed an issue where certain ice spells were not properly applying Frostbite (Glintstone Icecrag and Zamor Icestorm).

#Version 0.3.75

An update.

A new item called the Whetblade Fragment has been added to Kale's shop. The Whetblade Fragment can be used at the nearby smithing table to permanently unlock 1 infusion of your choice before finding its corresponding whetblade.

Deflects have received some updates to make them smoother to use and more consistent. Fast enemy attacks can be deflected more easily and tapping the button will give a minimum of 3 frames of deflection instead of 1.

More enemies have gotten updated hitboxes. The Ancestral Spirits, Omens, and Marionette/Avionettes now have more accurate hitboxes. The Regal Ancestral Spirit can now also use a cut ability, its iconic "big antler mode."

Increased the animation speed of Frenzyflame Thrust. Fixed some spell follow-ups like the Gavel of Haima. Fixed Claymen dropping many more souls than intended.

Version 0.3.72

Small update to fix bugs and issues introduced after the latest update.

Fixed the Fallen Hawk soldiers in Nokron giving way too many souls. Adjusted the soul values of some other enemies to better match their level of strength.

Fixed an issue with Deflects not making certain enemy attacks recoil. Fixed the Magma Wyrm in the lava lake missing the lava protection effect.

Updated weapon Critical values. The Critical number will be more accurate to the strength of the weapons critical attacks relative to its base damage. Weapons that cannot perform Critical attacks now have a value of 0, arrows now have a value of 150 to represent the headshot multiplier.

Added a passive ability to Fell weapons that increases the drain rate of the Rot, Frost, Madness, and Curse status effects. Added a passive ability to Gravitational, Cold, Bolt, Occult, Bestial, and Sacred weapons that boosts damage slightly when facing specific types of enemies.

Crystalians have received updated hitboxes. The spear ones were as bad as you'd expect them to be. Crystalian AI and fight mechanics will be updated at a later time.

Added some AI checks so Radahn won't fail to enter phase 1.5 for the entirety of phase 1 if you manage to stay behind him.

Version 0.3.7

Includes updates to enemy rune values and other fixes.

Big soul changes. These changes involved giving every enemy a base rune value that scales with their strength. Overall, basic enemies should give more rune, minibosses should give around the same, and major bosses should give less. Fighting enemies while traversing areas should be more rewarding, but there will surely be spots that need tuning after a large change like this, so feedback will be appreciated.

Along with the rune changes, the exponential cost of leveling up has been slightly decreased, so higher levels will cost less. At the higher end near level 700, the cost been reduced from around 8 million runes to around 7 million per level.

More smithing stones have been added to merchant shops. This includes more tier [3] stones around Liurnia and the Altus Plateua.

Player guardbreaks have been changed. Being guardbroken will now deal a bit of damage (15% of your maximum health) and lower stamina recovery, but the animation itself has been sped up. This damage will not happen if you are under 16% health, so it can't kill you.

The Ancient Hero of Zamor has been updated, with improved hitboxes, more deadly ice attacks, and some new abilities. To counter the overall tougher fight, certain annoying multi-hits of the Ancient Hero have been made slower and more dodgeable.

Added a passive boost to FP regeneration on hit to Magic affinity weapons. Relaxed Mode now comes with an automatic Rune Arc effect that persists through death. The Ripple weapons can now use Ashes of War.

Fixed the vanilla bugs of invisible enemies and the Death's Poker unintended hitstop effect. Also fixed the Blackflame Tornado weapon skill removing weapon buffs.

Version 0.3.61

Small update to fix some bugs.

The perfect deflect bug where the visual effect would not appear if triggered multiple times in a row has been fixed.

Fixed the issue where multiple enemy attacks that should not trigger a recoil animation did when hitting a player's perfect deflect.

Fixed an issue with Malenia, Blade of Miquella's AI, and made multiple slight balance adjustments to Malenia, Blade of Miquella overall.

Fixed the improperly placed spirit ash healthbar. The spirit ash healthbar has been moved to a location that doesn't overlap with anything, in the top left of the screen.

Added Hard mode, a difficulty option between the standard difficulty and Master.

Version 0.3.6

Includes updates to multiple different features.

Margit's AI has been fixed, he will now be more aggressive and use all of his combos, especially on Master Mode. Mohg has also received some changes that should hopefully eliminate the rare double Nihil bug.

Magma Wyrms and Night's Cavalry have received updated damage negation values, balanced around 1x damage being neutral, so they are not as incredibly tanky. This was overlooked when updating their HP values.

Deflects have received some adjustments to the timing, visuals, and effects of perfect deflects. Perfect deflects will now increase your guard "flick power" (flick power is what makes enemies bounce off your shield). Additionally, an issue has been fixed where deflecting multiple times in a row would not reset the cooldown of the stamina penalty that occurs when raising your guard. The amount of knockback received when blocking attacks or being guardbroken has been adjusted as well.

The Stat-knot Crystal Tear effects have been increased in duration from 3 minutes to 10. This is to help RL1 runs increase their stats.

More speed increases. Bear Witness!, Golden Tempering, Black Flame Tornado, and more.

All smithing stones from enemies have received increased drop rates. Gold-eyed enemies now drop x8 runes instead of x5.

Version 0.3.5

Includes updates to some bosses, and a new way to regenerate FP.

FP can now be regenerated by simply attacking enemies. The amount recovered per attack scales with the strength of the attack type and the maximum FP. At 60 Mind, a colossal weapon R1 should recover around 30 FP. This new method of FP recovery rewards participating in close-quarters combat.

Mohg, the Omen, located in the sewers of Leyndell, is now a phantom, just like Loretta and Godfrey. This matches this version of Mohg's immunity to status effects, which the other two phantom enemies also share.

Placidusax has received Master AI changes. His strength now actually matches the title of "Dragonlord."

Magma Wyrms have been changed so that their phase shift mechanic works a bit differently. They will now alternate between standing and crawling throughout the fight.

Fire-tailed Erdtree Burial Watchdogs have gotten a slight, frenzied, phase 2.

Also includes speed increases to the casting animations of all lightning-based incantations and increased the damage boost crossbows gain by reinforcement. Bows should also have better ADS accuracy.

Version 0.3.41

Small update to fix some issues.

The Draconic Tree Sentinel AI has been fixed.

Astel has received some new and updated attacks, and more challenging AI. Master Astel is even harder.

Added the ability to breakdown smithing stones into smaller smithing stones, and the ability to combine smithing stones into larger ones. This can be done in the crafting menu, and can be done to any regular smithing stone you have the corresponding Bell-Bearing for. Alternatively, defeating Radagon will now automatically and permanently unlock all smithing stones in the shop and crafting menu.

Also includes speed increases to the Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker and Flowing Form weapon skills.

Version 0.3.4

Includes balance changes and bug fixes.

A few new items have been added to the crafting menu. Rune Arcs and Larval Tears can now be crafted, as well as Golden Runes. Golden Runes can be used to store runes, with 25% of the runes being lost in the process. Golden Runes also now display their value in their name.

Deflects have been fixed, normal deflects now consume the proper amount of stamina, and perfect deflects consume basically 0 stamina.

A slightly more compact HUD has been added, with the Weapon Skill text slightly closer to the rest of the weapons and the status bars moved to the side. If you don't want this HUD for whatever reason, you can simply remove the .gfx file from the menu folder.

The Draconic Tree Sentinel has received some hitbox adjustments on their overly large hammer-axe-thing, and along with that some Master mode AI changes. The Godskin Apostle and Noble have also gained some new combos on Master mode.

More animation speed increases. Crystal Release, Eoachid's Dancing Blade, and other terribly slow attacks.

Other bugfixes include fixes to Poison/Blood/Occult weapon scaling and difficulty options that now properly increase item discovery.

Version 0.3.3

Includes a balance changes to affinities and deflects.

All weapons have received the necessary stat adjustments so most affinities should not be incredibly overpowered. This was most noticeable on weapons with very "spiked" scaling, meaning high scaling in one stat and little to none in the other.

Deflects have received more frames. Standard deflects from 8 -> 10 frames and perfect deflects from 3 -> 4. This is at 30 FPS. Also, perfect deflecting a high knockback attack will now properly provide multi-hit protection for the entire animation.

Version 0.3.2

Includes a Calibrations update and some fixes.

ERR is now updated for Calibrations ver 1.04.2.

All affinities with duplicate status effects should be fixed. More balancing of affinities will be included in the next update.

Also added a new difficulty. Relaxed mode is like Simple mode but more relaxed.

Version 0.3.1

Includes huge affinity changes and some bug fixes.

All player damage scaling has been reworked. Simply leveling up a weapon will no longer give as big of a damage increase, stats are more impactful now.

Affinities have received a huge update. There are 10 new affinities, with affinities for each damage type and status.

Black Knife Assassins having 1998x the intended amount of HP has been fixed. The Magma Wyrm Makar and Ranni's Rise sites of grace should now work. Also, the Rune Bears have better hitboxes and won't fall through the map.

Version 0.3.0

I wasn't gonna release another update so fast but there was an important bug to fix.

Includes an important fix to some bosses health and more speed changes.

Fixed an issue where certain minibosses had double the intended amount of health. This affected certain Crucible Knights, Cemetery Shades, Omenkillers, and some other minibosses.

Colossal weapons have gotten another decrease to their delay. You can now chain attacks or dodge even more quickly.

More sorceries have received updates. These include the Magma, Gravity, Blood, Death and Bubble sorceries.

The dragons (Agheel, Smarag, Ekzykes, Borealis) and Dragonlord Placidusax have gotten hitbox updates. One of the most notable things affected by this is their fire breath.

Thanks to SAMURAI for the japanese translation of the boss menu.

Version 0.2.9

Includes even more deflect adjustments, more speed increases, and boss resurrection updates.

Perfect Deflects will now properly consume no stamina. The cost of raising your guard now scales depending on how many times it is used in succession, so raising your guard once barely consumes any stamina now.

More spells and skills have received speed increases. These include Rennala's Full Moon, Hoarah Loux's Earthshaker and more.

Enemies with hitbox improvements this patch include Banished Knights, the Night's Cavalry, and Commander Niall. Banished Knights really needed these fixes.

Boss resurrection is now only viewable at the Roundtable Hold, and has an updated menu. Defeated bosses will appear and should persist even through NG+.

Version 0.2.8

Includes updates to perfect deflects, guard counter speed increases, and more.

Deflects and blocks will more reliably lead into guard counters, and perfect deflects should more reliably block multi-hit attacks.

Renamed Demon mode.

Guard counters have received a large reduction in animation endlag. They'll now be much safer to use.

More enemies have received hitbox adjustments. This time its the Rats, and the Kindred of Rot. These enemies can now both inflict a status effect as well.

Also includes more animation speed increases to certain attacks, like Greyoll's Roar and Dragonmaw.

Version 0.2.7

Includes perfect deflects, poise fixes/changes, spell, ash of war, and colossal weapon speed increases, and other bugfixes.

Perfect deflects can be done by doing an even better timed deflect. Doing it will release a storm AoE that staggers weak enemies and empower your counterattack. Perfect deflects will reduce all damage and status buildup to 0, and also have the ability to block multi-hit attacks.

Added Demon mode.

Enemy poise has received some changes, see them under the All Enemies section in the Changelog. Additionally, the amount of poise most enemies have has been changed. Smaller enemies should be easier to stagger for the most part, this counteracts the nerf to attack multipliers a few patches ago. Also, for nearly all bosses, HP has been raised slightly.

The animation speed of certain spells and ashes of war have been increased. Most of these are to match the vanilla updates. Colossal Weapon attacks can also be cancelled faster now, up to 10 frames faster on certain attacks.

The Elemer of the Briar has received some much needed hitbox adjustments.

Guardbreak animations have been changed to reduce player poise to 0, so you shouldn't take more than 1 hit while guardbroken. Also includes some super important fixes to things like the accept angle of the Climb and Descend ladder buttons.

Thanks to pelooleq for the French translation of the menu options.

Version 0.2.5

Updated for Calibrations Ver. 1.04.1

Also includes some modifications to Deflect but that was only out in the previous state for like half a day so who cares.

Version 0.2.4

Includes the Deflect and Duck abilities and some bug fixes.

Deflects can be performed by timing your block while two-handing any weapon. Ducks have replaced backsteps as an evasion option. See the changelog for more details.

Fixed an issue with Crystal Barrage consuming more FP and stamina than intended. Hopefully all of those spells are now fixed.

The base poise damage of certain weapon categories has been increased to account for the reduction to certain high poise damage multipliers on attacks. Also slightly boosted the damage of powerstanced attacks by around 5%.

Version 0.2.2

Includes some initial changes to weapon arts and some important bug fixes for "hold" spells.

The base costs and other values of weapon skills have been adjusted for all skills. Any more specific changes to certain weapon skills can be found in the Changelog.

All "hold" spells should be fixed and should no longer consume ridiculous amounts of FP/stamina.

Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree has received some Master mode specific difficulty changes. Grave Warden Duelists have received some improved hitboxes and a new intro animation. The Large Spider Hands have improved hitboxes and are slightly slower during some attacks (but they still suck.)

Other balance changes include the buffs to the status-resistance-boosting talismans and difficulty dependent FP regeneration.

Version 0.2.1

Includes more rebalanced spells, Master versions of Radagon and Radahn, and some important bug fixes.

Many new spells have been rebalanced, most of them being support Incantations. More buffs are stackable, and spells like Darkness are much more useful. (Darkness does what the description says it does now.)

Radagon and Radahn have received much more challenging AI when playing on Master mode. Also includes some speed changes to the attacks of certain bosses throughout the game, Beast Clergyman should be much more bearable while Godrick will be a bit more threatening.

Melina is (hopefully) fixed and should now talk to the player at Sites of Grace again. Other bugfixes include fixes to certain casting animations and spells. Also, FP regeneration now is % based instead of just 2 per second. It can now scale up to 5 FP per second at 99 Mind.

Version 0.2.0

Includes the start of a large rebalancing of spells, an experimental boss resurrection feature, and plenty of fixes.

The spell rebalance includes changes to the Cast Speed stat as well as changes to plenty of individual spells. The changes to Cast Speed and the unique spell changes are in the Changelog.

Boss Resurrection is an experimental feature where you can respawn supported bosses at a Site of Grace. To avoid issues, do not respawn a boss while resting at a Site of Grace located in that bosses arena. This is experimental for a reason, unforeseen issues may occur if you use this feature.

Also fixes bugs like Spirit Ash NG+ scaling, difficulty options causing Margit to get shackled, certain issues with the input of rolls after being staggered, and other stuff like Tree Spirit and Royal Revenant hitbox improvements. Also also adds a very, very slight 2 FP per second FP regen passively.

Version 0.1.9

Includes a huge update to poise values, some fixes to NG+ scaling values, updates to the timing of guard counters, and the initial implementation of different difficulty settings.

Poise should now be at least slightly effective at allowing one to act through weaker enemy attacks. A bonus multiplier to poise has been added that depends on the % of your health remaining, and enemy poise damage has been lowered across the board.

The difficulty options can be accessed at any Site of Grace. Yes the curse is intentional. Full changes made by the two available options are in the Changelog.

Also includes some other small adjustments to things like the final bosses and some status effects.

Version 0.1.8

Includes a huge rebalance of weapon based status affliction and status effect damage, You can also now kill enemies by blighting them.

Bows have been buffed with increased damage, scaling, and a faster fire rate, however they have way less range. Certain bows will have more range than others still. Light Bows fire even faster while crouched. Greatbows are a bit slower but deal increased damage and can fire successive shots faster.

Also includes other minor changes and +1 default spell slots for new characters.
